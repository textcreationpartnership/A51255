1. A FULLER DISCOVERY Of the Dangerous Principles and Lying ſpirit of the PEOPLE Called Quakers, Made manifeſt in George Whitehead, John Whitehead, and George Fox the Younger, in their Book againſt John Horne, and Tho. Moore of Lin.

    _ The Reply to their Book.

      * 1. Que. Their firſt question is, whether do you own that Chriſt hath two Bodies, one in Heaven, and another on Earth, yea or nay?

      * W. and F. Queſt. 2. Whether the Body of Chriſt which is the fulneſſe of God, whereof the Saints are members, is a Body of Fleſh and Bones in the Heavens? yea or nay.

      * W. F. 3. Querie, Whether did the body of fleſh and bones wherein Chriſt ſuffered deſcend from Heaven into the lower parts of the earth, yea or nay? ſeeing no man hath aſcended up to Heaven, but the Son of man which came down from Heaven, and it is the ſame that deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, that aſcended far above all heavens, that he might fill all things, Epheſ. 4. 9, 10. Pſal. 68. 18.

      * Q. 5 W. and F. And if he which deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, be a perſon of fleſh and bones which aſcended far above all Heavens; What is that place he is in far above all Heavens which is not Heaven?

      * Queſt. What is that place he is in, far above all Heavens which is not Heaven?

      * Queſt. 6. Whether do you believe that all the Heavens are local places one above another, and above the Firmament which is called Heaven? Yea or nay.

      * 7. Que. Can a body of Fleſh and Bones be both in the Heavens and far above them all, and fill all things at one and the ſame time? Yea or nay.

      * 8. Que. Seeing Thomas Moor did not own that Chriſts Body is a carnal body in Heaven: how is it that you ſay his Body is a body of Fleſh and Bones (or a Humane Body) without Blood in it; Is not a Fleſhly body Carnal?

      * Queſt. 9. Can any local place contain that Glory which Chriſt had with the Father before the world was, wherein he is glorified?

      * Queſt. 10. Where or how came Chriſt into the houſe where his Diſciples were met after

his Reſurrection, the doors being ſhut? John 20. 19. 26. Have not ſome of you ſaid, that then his body being ſpirituallized it glided in at the key hole of the door, for ſo it hath been ſpoken concerning ſome of your way.

      * Queſt. 11. Whether the ſame Chriſt who in the dayes of his fleſh ſuffered perſecution, whoſe body was ſubject to hunger and affliction, be not made a quickening ſpirit, 1 Cor. 15. 49. and yet his fleſh and blood is ſo nigh to every true believer, that his fleſh is his meat indeed, and his blood is his drink indeed, &c?

      * 12. Query. And if the blood of Chriſt that was ſhed be the drink indeed, and the purger of the conſcience, where is that blood, if not in Chriſts fleſh as you affirmed, ſeeing that men muſt drink the blood of Chriſt, as well as eat his Fleſh, or elſe they have no life in them?

      * Queſt. 13. And was the Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed, ſeparate from his body, and then bearing record on the earth when John wrote thoſe words, 1 John 5. 8.

      * Queſt. 14. And how can the blood of Chriſt either cleanſe any from ſin, or give life to any, if the life of Chriſt be not in it, as Thomas Moor affirmed.

      * Queſt. 15. How many comings of Chriſt do you own, ſeeing you have his ſecond coming without ſin to ſalvation yet to look for?

      * 16. Query, What are thoſe ſeeds that must have every one his own body in the Reſurrection, and whether are they Natural, or Spiritual?

      * 17. Query, And muſt not every ſeed have a body of its one Nature?

      * Queſt. 18. And whether the wicked upon whom after Death Judgement is come, whoſe Souls are in Hell, muſt afterward come out of Hell again to receive a ſecond Judgement?

      * Queſtion, 19. Whether the receiving Bread and Wine to ſhew the Lords death, be to continue an Ordinance in the Church till the end of the World, yea or nay?

      * 20. Que. And whether doth the receiving Bread and Wine alone, without on outward paſſeover, really figure forth the death of Chriſt?

      * 21. Query. And how muſt the life of Chriſt be ſhown forth? And when? If people muſt receive Bread and Wine as a continuing Ordinance in this life, alwayes to ſhew forth the death of Chriſt?

      * 22. Query. What is your ground for ſprinkling the Children of them you count Believers? Have you ever a command from God, or evident example for it, if you have ſhew it?

      * 23. Query. Whether do you own ſuch Preachers as take Tythes, or Preach for hire, or for gifts, and rewards, yea or nay?

      * 24. Query. What is the Soul of man which the Word of God is to ſave, and what is the difference between the Soul and the Spirit, ſeeing the Word of God divides them aſunder?

      * 25. Queſtion. Whether men muſt be juſtified by the ſame Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in them, which Sanctifies them, yea or nay?

      * 26. Queſtion. What is that Light with which Chriſt lighteth every man that cometh into the World, which Thomas Moor ſaid is both natural and Spiritual?
Thus have we anſwered in ſimplicity and plainneſſe, and not with hidden

things of diſhoneſty, but b
    _ To their fooliſh Queſtions in their Poſt-ſcript, we ſay,
