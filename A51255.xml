            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:110170:4"/>
preach as the true Chriſt, or as <hi>James Naylor</hi> in his Book called <hi>Love to the Loſt,</hi> ſayes is the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which Chriſt takes after the fleſh. We ſhall note ſome things here more particularly, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by Fleſh and Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, they mean not any natural Seed or Body of man, but a certain ſeed or principle in every mans mind whether he know it or no, which in ſome men is not fully able, but deſirous to follow after God, and be free from ſin, they ſay not to free him in whom it is from ſin, but to be free it ſelf from ſin, and yet this ſeed with them is the Chriſt, the Word that was made fleſh; the true light that is in every man that comes into the World, and that is manifeſted in men to take away their ſins; yet it cannot be ſaid (it ſeems) of it, that in it is no ſin, but for it deſires to be free from ſin and follow God, but (it seems) doth not nor can yet in ſome men till raiſed by the power, and when ſo manifeſted in men, they are perfectly ſinleſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they ſay this Seed or Chriſt is known in ſome men as ſuffering and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with corruption, and deſiring to be free from ſin, &amp;c. is not that the death of their Chriſt? or do they not blaſpheme the true Chriſt, who is raiſed and made a quickening ſpirit, while they repreſent him as one not able to do his Fathers will in ſome men, and as one that needs Redemption, and to be ſet free himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When they ſay this ſeed the power reaches to where it is begotten, and in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it ariſes, &amp;c. is not that the Reſurrection of Chriſt with them for mans Redemption and Juſtification; and ſo the believer in the light for redemption believes firſt in a dying Chriſt dying yet in him, unleſſe the light he believes in be another Chriſt, or ſome thing beſides Chriſt; or rather their candle-light, which is put out in the wicked, is all one with their Chriſt ſuffering, and making his grave with the wicked, and their Chriſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and riſing in men is the light reviving as the morning light in them, and then the man is redeemed and raiſed ſinleſſe too; and ſo there is their and their Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And yet again, mind their ſtrange expreſſing of this Redemption and Reſurrection of their Chriſt; <hi>This Seed,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Power reaches to where it is begotten, and in the Power it ariſeth.</hi> What is this power that they ſay reaches to that Seed, is it Chriſt or not Chriſt? If it be not Chriſt, then it ſeems their Chriſt crucified or burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with corruption is not the power of God, but needs another power to Redeem him, that is not he; no, alas their Chriſt lies ſtrugling under corruption, as weak it ſeems as the poor believer himſelf, that cryes out wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this Death. So that what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf as carnal and ſold under ſin, is true of their Chriſt in ſome, he would riſe and cannot, he wants power; he would do the will of the Father, but cannot it ſeems, till the power reach to him; and ſo he may ſay too as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform what I would I find not.</hi> If the power be the Chriſt, then how was Chriſt there where he lies bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with corruption in man, and making his grave with the wicked before he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? for the power is not begotten in all that Chriſt is in as a ſuffering ſeed, and ſo he ſuffers before he be begotten, and he by whom all things were made is in ſome men, and yet his power not begotten; which when it reaches to the ſeed, it riſes in it by degrees ſurely as men in whom he is, give way to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yea, here we may ſee the reigning of their Chriſt too, and of his Saints with him, in that they ſay, <hi>in ſome he ſuffers, and in others he reigns, and is known to be Prince of Peace:</hi> Is Chriſt divided then? or doth ſome part of him in ſome ſuffer, and other part reign in others; it ſeems he hath neither done dying, nor been at any time
<pb facs="tcp:110170:4"/>
without his Reigning, and his to Reign with him, ſo that here we have the Myſtery of their Religion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nay, what is this ſeeds riſing but the Redemption of the body with them; for as for the Redemption of any Natural body of man from the Natural death on them, or judgement on them after that death, they plainly deny it; onely they talk of a ſeed ſhall riſe, and what is that but this ſeed that they ſay Chriſt takes after the fleſh?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Note here alſo how this their imagined Christ differs from our Chriſt, the true Chriſt witneſsed to and Preached in the Scriptures; for their Rock is not as our Rock, their Chriſt as our Chriſt, themſelves being Judges, <hi>Deut. 32. 31.</hi> with their Book, <hi>pag 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> our Rock is God in Christ, and ſo our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, between whom and their Christ conſider theſe differences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Chriſt is that Holy and Innocent man that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and lived in his perſonal body upon the Earth in the dayes of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius Ceſars</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews;</hi> And who in that body of his was crucified or nayled on a Tree, died and was buried, and roſe again the third day, and appeared in the ſame body to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, after which he in that his body left the World, aſcending up from the Earth into the higheſt Heavens, where he is Glorified with Gods own Self, the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelling in him bodily, He being God over all bleſsed for ever; This is he whom theſe perverters deny and jears at as having the form and body of a Man, and ſet up another thing in his stead, that hath neither perſonal head, hands nor feet, fleſh or bones proper to himſelf, but an imaginary ſeed within every man, deſiring to follow after God, and be free from ſin, which they call the Light, the Chriſt, the Power of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Chriſt in a perſonal body of his own distinst from, and out of our bodies, bare our ſins to and on the Tree or Croſſe, and ſo in that body died for our ſins, and in the ſame body roſe for our justification, that we believing in him might be justified by his Blood, and accepted in his Righteouſneſſe, and from thence have ſin die in us, and we dying to ſin might live to Righteouſneſſe; Theſe plead for a Chriſt, without any body of man distinct from others, or out of them, but a certain ſeed with an imaginary fleſh and blood, dying and beating ſin in every man, and riſing where the Power reaches to it in men, having no other body but what is in ſome men dying, yea in every man in its time, and in ſome men riſing but not in all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Chriſt in his ſaid body did once, and but once in the last Ages of the World, little more then, one thouſand ſix hundred years ſince, ſuffer and die, and riſe again and, can now therein die no more, death hath no more dominion over him, but he is alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in that body Glorified in the Heavens, which theſe perverters deny; But their Chriſt is alwayes ſuffering, and ſo dying in ſome men and riſing in others, and reigning in ſome, and ſo hath been alwayes dying and riſing in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n from the beginning of the World, and ſo will be to the end, their words plainly enough import as much.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Chriſt by that his death once ſuffered, and in his Reſurrection in that his body, &amp; that body once in ſacrifice offered up to God, hath overcome Death and the Devil, ſlain the enmity and taken out of the way all that was contrary to us, redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, obtained eternal Redemption for us, and received the immeaſurable fulneſs of the Spirit in the man and for men, and is become Wiſdom Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption, being by virtue of all his foreſaid ſufferings and ſacrifice, the propitiation for the ſins of the whole World of man kind, the Mediator of God and men, that all that believe in him may by Faith be reckoned after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and receive of the virtues hereof, a firſt fruits of the Spirit, making their Spirits li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e for Righteouſneſſe ſake, and giving
<pb facs="tcp:110170:5"/>
them the hope of the fulneſs in Soul and Body at his coming again to be enjoyed by them for which they wait, of all which theſe Perverters make nothing, as <hi>James Naylor</hi> writ to a certain Gentleman by way of reproach; Thou lookeſt to be ſaved by a man that dyed 1600. years ago; this is that they ſcoff at, giving out in their words that the death they mean of, is not the death of a man in a Mortal body which was Natural and muſt have dyed, they ſay, though ſin had never been; But the death they mean is the death of the Seed or Chriſt that is alwayes dying and riſing, ſometime in one and ſometime in another, which death and reſurrection they extol, and account the other but a ſhadow and figure of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Chriſt being in his glorified Bodie in the Heavens, the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelling in him bodily, by his ſpirit draws in many to believe in him of whom he in his Perſonal body is the Head and they the Members are one ſpiritual body or Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But theſe Perverters denying that their Chriſt hath any Perſonal body, made but one Body in and of all, and that the Seed ſure, for the Natural Bodies of themſelves and others, they ſay muſt die and never riſe again, and therefore ſure they are in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count no part of Chriſts Body that muſt live ever, and ſure that Seed is no Perſonal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but a conceited ſpirit that is within them with a conceited fleſh and blood in them to; This is the fulneſſe of God they ſay, whereof they are every one of them in this Seed the Members; ſuch an Idol was ſcarce ever in any Generation of men ſet up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our Chriſt is by his Word and ſpirit, and the riches of his Grace in the hearts of his people by faith quickening and inlivening them, which theſe perverters deny and jeer at, and ſay, Their <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all the reality of his Body with his Fleſh and Blood is wholly within them <hi>(for ſo ſome of them have ſaid)</hi> even ſenſibly bearing their ſins in them, though not willingly as <hi>Chriſt</hi> bare ours on the Tree, but deſiring to be free, and ſo is riſing in them and reigning in Glory; So as the Redemption and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body others wait for, theſe ſay they, have in this body within, a pleaſing fancy.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Our <hi>Chriſt</hi> will come again perſonally in his own Glorious Body, and every eye ſhall ſee him, in which coming he will, not by degrees or one after another, but at once together in one moment in the twinkling of an eye change the ſurviving, and raiſe the dead bodies of all that ſleep in Jeſus, ſo as they ſhall be all mortal, and meet him in the air, and appear in Glory with him freed from all Hunger, Perſecution, Sorrow and death for ever, and bleſſed in the enjoyment of him with whom they ſhall reign for evermore; and when he is ſet on his Throne, he will gather all Nations before him raiſing all men, not leaving out theſe Deceivers, but all ſhall appear before his Judgement Seat even thoſe that rebel againſt him, and in this day deny him, then ſhall they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him Lord, and his People that have now confeſt him the beloved of the Lord, when themſelves ſhall be judged by him and ſent into the Lake of Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which coming of his and the Reſurrection of the dead and judgement after death (the bodily death) is by thoſe Perverters alſo altogether denyed, they owning no other coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> then ſome of them enjoy now, nor other Reſurrection then is now ſometime of one and ſometime of another, and yet they of them that enjoy the Reſurrection of the body, they talk of ſometime bunger, and feel pain and cry out of Perſecution, and muſt die the bodily, yea and riſe again to the ſecond death too.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Our <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath by his ſpirit ſo fully diſcovered himſelf in the Teſtimony of the
<pb facs="tcp:110170:5"/>
Goſpel that is the written verity, that in and according to the plain import of the ſaying thereof he is to be known ſo far as we may know him till his coming again, and by and wit that the Holy Spirit doth witneſſe of him to, and teach the hearts of the believers, and they from the ſame ſpirit, and according to the ſame Goſpel do conſide in him, confeſſe him and hold him ſorth to others, and for that are oppoſed by theſe perverters; Of whoſe Chriſt and their Doctrine of him, though whatever is ſaid of the true Chriſt or of his Church in the Scripture they apply to their falſe Chriſt, and to themſelves, as if they meant no other Chriſt nor faith then the Scriptures ſpeak of, perverting them to that end; Yet the ſcripture writing indeed ſpeaketh not but to the condemnation, overthrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion thereof: warning all believers not to hear or follow them, nor receive them to houſe, nor bid them God-ſpeed; But hold them accurſed, beware them and avoid them as Wolves, falſe Apoſtles, and Reprobate concerning the Faith. Such the Doctrine and Principles which theſe men call the truth, which indeed is errour and darkneſſe, let the Scriptures be compared.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the manner of their managing and maintaining their doctrine, let theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars amongſt divers others be noted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They come in their own name or authority, boaſting of themſelves and witneſſing to and of themſelves: and ſo obtruding things upon men, not by and in the light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſpirit, in and according to the Scriptures, as the true Apoſtles uſe to do, but upon their own authority and the authority of their ſayings, and witneſſings which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſay alſo are of equal authority with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Better than the ſaying of the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures, as appeares by <hi>George Whiteheads</hi> anſwers to the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge Queries.</hi> To this purpoſe is their ſaying in their <hi>Title Page,</hi> that what they have written and made manifeſt in their Book is, they ſay, by the Truth (they ſay not which is in Chriſt or in the Goſpel of Chriſt, but) which is in <hi>George Whitehead, John Whitehead, George Fox</hi> the younger, to which three witneſſes in their own names, We oppoſe the three in Heaven, the Father, the Son or Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and the truth that is in and is witneſsed by them, much of this their way of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſing and obtruding things in their own name, word or authority, the Reader may ſee in their Book, <hi>p. 8. 13. 18. 20, 21, 22, 23. 26.</hi> In which they are ſuch as the falſe Chriſts and the falſe Prophets, of whom our Lord ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> if another come in his own name, him ye will receive, <hi>John 5. 43.</hi> And like the Idol worſhippers and preachers, of whom the Lord ſays by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that they were their own wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>Iſa 44. 9.</hi> And though they ſay the Lord ſaith, yet they do therein as the falſe prophets affirming the Name of the Lord to their own words, dreames, fancies, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, as in <hi>Jer. 23. 16. 25, 26, 27. Ezek. 13. 7.</hi> As we might alſo inſtance in ſome they have ſaid of that they were Prieſts, and Hirelings, and took Tythes that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exerciſed in ſuch away, as a certain woman ſaid of <hi>Thomas Moor junior,</hi> at <hi>Glentworth</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaid in <hi>Bury Goal,</hi> of one <hi>Disbrough</hi> brother in law to <hi>Joſeph Hagger,</hi> being a trads-man in <hi>London,</hi> yet they pretended that they ſpeak by the Revelation of the ſpirit of them in which their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and deceit was made manifeſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they do quote Scripture, they uſually pervert and corrupt it, altering, leaving out ſomething, or adding thereto corrupt and falſe gloſſes; we may inſtance ſome few particulars, in their book againſt us. As,</p>

            <p n="3">3. They maintain their falſe conceits by falacious or ſenceleſſe reaſoning, ſyllogizings and inferences, as at the diſpute at <hi>Lin, George Whitehead</hi> to prove all ſin to be guil, brought this falacy; All ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the <hi>Law,</hi> guile is a tranſgreſſion of the Law, therefore guile is all ſin, which any that underſtand the rules of <hi>Syllogiſmes</hi> know to be a <hi>Paralogiſme,</hi> or falſe reaſoning, ſuch as the Apoſtle in the <hi>Greek</hi> Text of <hi>Col. 2. 4.</hi> Expreſly faults and warns us of, and in their Book <hi>G.

Every Beaſt is an Aſſe or a living Creature, and all Aſses includes all Beaſts; Therefore every Beaſt (Foxes and Wolves to) as an Aſſe, <hi>p. 5.</hi> Again in the ſame page, they prove all ſin to be guile, thus. Any one ſin makes a man guilty, and ſo he hath guile in him, a fooliſh inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as if guile and guilt were one and the ſame thing, whereas <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> being a Scholler knows the contrary, and therefore therein he wilfully playes the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> or <hi>Sopheſter</hi> to delude the Ignorant with ſeeming like tearmes. So <hi>pag. 1.</hi> to prove the perfection of ſinleſſeneſſe in themſelves they ſay, the perfection of ſinleſſeneſſe is in the witneſſe of God, as if that and themſelves were one and the ſame, and <hi>pag. 6.</hi> to prove that <hi>Adam</hi> might have died the natural death, though he had not ſinned, they argue as thus. Becauſe Chriſt who had no ſin, not conſidering that Chriſt had our ſins laid upon him, and for them he died, but <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have had no ſin laid upon him, or imputed to him, had he not ſinned himſelf; But ſuch like reaſonings are too many to number up in them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They carry on their falſe deſigns and doctrines with lies and falſhood moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in ſaying often, that we accuſe the Saints, and plead for ſin, <hi>p. 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> And in belying <hi>J.

Again, in ſaying we might as well have accuſed the true Prophets and Apoſtles with being Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of lies, and deceivers, as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and that the ſame Spirit in us that hath accuſed the <hi>Quakers</hi> with being deceivers (that is the Spirit of Truth) would have accuſed the true Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt and his Apoſtles for being deceivers, <hi>page. 5.</hi> That we contradict our ſelves in many things where we have made it
<pb facs="tcp:110170:8"/>
we have made it evident there is no contradiction; That we look for a Chriſt like our ſelves, but that he hath no Blood in his Body as we imagine, p. 10. That our expecting the Redemption of the Body to be waited for aſter Death, is contrary to the Saints expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. p. 11. and 12. In which words is both equivocation and falſhood, that what the Scriptures ſay of Chriſt and his Body they own, in which they alſo either equivocate or ſay falſly, or both; they equivocate if by owning they mean as probably they do, they own it as true of themſelves, <hi>(the Quakers)</hi> as if the things ſpoken of Chriſt and his Church are verified in and of them, and may be affirmed of them; Or if by owning they mean they believe and hold them true concerning Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and them that believe on him to be ſaved through the virtue of his ſufferings, Sacrifice and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, then they ſay falſly. Yea, whether this or the former be their meaning, they are falſe therein, as our reply makes manifeſt to the impartial Reader; But who can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber up their lies and falſhoods in falſifying our ſayings, and otherwiſe which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reply will further evidence. He that will procure and ſearch and compare what <hi>Chriſtopher Wade</hi> of <hi>Water-beach</hi> hath written againſt them, with their writings againſt him, may ſee a whole dozen of notorious lies of <hi>George Foxes,</hi> clearly proved againſt him, to which <hi>G.

            <p n="5">5. They miſrelate and give the go-by to many of our charges and ſayings, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; We quoted <hi>Jam. 3. 2.</hi> to prove all believers here to have ſin, or ſometime to offend, to this they ſay nothing, onely quote the place and give it the go-by, telling us onely that <hi>James</hi> exhorted men to let patience have its perfect work, &amp;c. Which is nothing to the purpoſe, p. 3. So what we ſaid of the Nature of man, as it is in Chriſt, diſcharged of ſin, Law and Death, in his Reſurrection, p. 10. Of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book, that they repreſent it as if we had ſaid it of the Nature and being of man, as in us to be diſcharged in our Reſurrection, p. 11. And whereas we charged them with denying the Humanity of Chriſt, as to its being now in him, they give it the go-by, anſwering onely that they never denied the Man Chriſt, for his fleſh is their food, p. 14. Whereas they had before denied him to have any other Body then his Church, p. 8. And to our ſaying, that Chriſt is not really and perſonally in the believer, as in Heaven, but by Faith, they let go the words perſonally and as in Heaven, in their anſwer, and traduce us as denying any real being of him by Faith in the believer, p. 14. More ſuch like dealings thou mayſt find in p. 15. and 18. and divers others.</p>

Therefore ſome in times paſt that were ſtrangers to this Grace, and did ſeek life in a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Righteouſneſse, and by their ſtrifes after ſuch Righteouſneſſe to evidence and manifeſt to themſelves and others, not otherwiſe knowing that they were in a Gracious ſtate and had unfeigned Faith; And others that pretend Chriſt in men, and the true Light in them, but they know it not, and that their Miniſtration unto men is not to bring out of darkneſſe into Light, but to manifeſt to them the Light and Chriſt that were before in them, (to whom therefore that name of <hi>Manifeſtarians</hi> might more properly be given) I ſay ſome ſuch Nick-named them, and reproached them with the Name of <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and amongſt them <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> in his <hi>Gangraena,</hi> was pleaſed to vent his paſſion in that reproachful tearm, ſince whoſe writing we have ſcarce ever met with it from any other, till theſe three brethren in evil have therewith reproached the people taught by us; yea, and not content with that, they add in a Parentheſis,</p>

A Prieſt in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſence, to make the body of Chriſt under viſible formes and accidents (as theſe men called <hi>Quakers</hi> do in a manner in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations inviſibly) and to offer up a propitiatory ſacrifice for the quick and for the dead; if ſo they know themſelves to be lyars therein to; For they know that none ſuch are allowed by the profeſt Church in <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for many years. Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Heathen Prieſt appointed to offer bodily and bloody ſacrifices to ſome Idol or falſe God, if they uſe it in ſuch a ſence, they then not onely reproach and lie againſt <hi>John Horn,</hi> and the other, but alſo intimately blaſpheme againſt God and Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, as if he was but an Heathen Idol or falſe God, for to none other doth <hi>John Horn</hi> perform any Act of Divine Worſhip; Its probable they mean it in this ſence, for ſo one of their ſociety at <hi>Whitheſee</hi> called one, that reads the Scripture in the Congregation, Prieſt, and when intreated to forbear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe the Scriptures read are the Words of God, and diſcover Chriſt the Lord, and prayers were directed to God in his Name, and the Goſpel by one alſo was then Preached, and Chriſt is the true Lord and not <hi>Baal,</hi> he grew more fierce at that, and called, <hi>Mattan, Mattan, Mattan,</hi> meaning <hi>Mattan</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Baal, 2 Kings 11. 18.</hi> By which thou mayeſt ſee, Reader, what reproachers they be of Chriſt, and the Chriſtian Religion; in any of theſe bad ſences if they uſe this tearm Prieſt of <hi>J.

            <p n="4">4. If they uſe it as prophane men in contempt of the Miniſters, that know not elſe what ſence the word Prieſt hath, ſave onely they judge it reproachful, then have they at beſt joyned therein with the falſe prophane ſcoffers, <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> and evil men; And ſo it appeares however that they were not led by the Spirit of Truth which leads none to be revilers, ſo that had they called their writing their own witneſſe, and not the witneſſer of the truth in them (which indeed is not to them, <hi>1 John 1. 8. 10.</hi>) they had done yet leſſe evilly then they have in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their falſhoods and reproaches upon the Truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="7">7. To name no more, They carry on their own work by proud boaſtings and ſpeaking high ſwelling words of vanity vaunting of themſelves, and in that alſo walk in the ſteps of the falſe Apoſtles, and falſe Teachers, who were proud boaſters, Fierce, Heady, High-minded, diſpiſers of them that are good, &amp;c.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow groſſely Ignorant, miſerably Erroneous, and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wicked the Quakers be, all may perceive, that are of ability to judge and diſcern indifferently, between us and them, in what hath bin publiſhed by either of us, yet for the ſakes of thoſe that are not able to diſcern, by a bare reading of what they have writ, or will not be at the paines to compare us impartially. We have herein further noted their Ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Errour, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Hypocriſie, and Deceit, to their hands, in which they that will but compare us, may ſee our integrity in our dealing with them. However, we ſhall deſire to Approve our ſelves to God therein, and make manifeſt their deceits and falſhood, ſo as all that will may diſcern them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They lay down ten Principles in their Epiſtle to the Reader, as ours in which they ſhew their ignorance and deceit; they be thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T. Moor</hi> (ſay they) affirmed, That ſin is a natural heritage in the beleevers while they be here: To which <hi>T. Moor</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:110170:12"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is falſly expreſſed, his ſayings were, That ſin is in the beleever as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heritage from <hi>Adam,</hi> while he is in this mortal body. And in noting this as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, they intimately deny the natural uncleanneſs of man by ſin entring into the world by one mans ſin, and ſo that all have ſinned in him, <hi>and are fallen ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> in and unto which they were created: Or elſe with the Papiſts imagine that its taken away by Baptiſm or Regeneration, ſo as no more to be in men here: But note, that <hi>T. M.</hi> ſays its in them as a natural heritage, from the firſt natural root, fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> in which is implied a diſtinction between what is the beleevers by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a ſon of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> a man; and what is his by grace, as in Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin,</hi> and that it abides in the beleever, after beleeving is plain, in that <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, ſin dwelt in him, even then when he ſays, it was not he that did ſin, but ſin in him, <hi>Rom. 7. 17, 20. For I know that in me</hi> (that is in my fleſh) <hi>dwelleth no good thing;</hi> there his natural heritage: In which alſo he implies, that in his Spirit was that that is good dwelling, as alſo he after ſays, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. and that ſin abides not in the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till death, we find no Scripture ſaith, but the contrary, <hi>That no man living ſhall be juſtified in the ſight of God if he enter into judgement with him,</hi> Pſal. 143. 2. If no man living, but by Gods not entring into judgment with him, then no man living here is without ſin, for if there were, though God did enter into judgement with him, he ſhould be juſtified, for God certainly cannot in judgment, or will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him in whom is no ſin; ſo that their ignorance and error herein appears, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing <hi>T. M.</hi> of Error herein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>T. M.</hi> (ſay they) affirmed, that their nature is reſtored in Chriſt (ſpeaking of their own nature) and that their nature is a filthy nature, and Chriſt took upon him their nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This alſo is falſly expreſſed and perverted, for his ſayings were to this effect: That the nature or kind of man is perfectly redeemed and reſtored in one for all, even in Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> while yet ſin is in, and death upon the Individuals, or particular perſons of men, for whom ſuch Redemption is obtained in and by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: Yea, even the beleevers body is yet vile, while not changed by death, and they all waiting for the redemption of the body; but here they confound things together and deal deceitfully, they might as well have taxed the Apoſtle of confuſion, for ſaying, <hi>men by nature do the things contained in the Law,</hi> Rom. 2. 14. and yet by <hi>nature are children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. The word Nature ſignifies diverſly, when we ſay our nature is reſtored in Chriſt, we ſpeak of the nature or kind of man as it is diſtinguiſhed from the nature or kind of Angels and other creatures, which whole nature by reaſon of ſin committed by it in <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen under wrath and curſe; but being aſſumed by Chriſt (who was made fleſh, and man, and not in the nature or kind of Angels) he hath redeemed it (even mans nature or being, which is ours too inaſmuch as we are men) and reſtored it to favour and fellowſhip with God in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet we ſay our nature, kind, or being, as in us, not in Chriſt (for the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, kind, or being of man, is in every man, though in divers perſons diverſly) is corrupt and filthy in it ſelf by reaſon of ſin in it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64. 6. and death upon us, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then purified and purged by him, yet Chriſt took upon him our nature (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) not as it is filthy in us by ſin in it, but as it was under bondage to death and ourſe without filth in him, he being ſanctified in his conception, ſo as to be the Holy One even in his Birth, (<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.) whereas others are <hi>conceived in ſin, and ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:110170:12"/>
(Pſal. 51. 5.) ſo that there is neither error nor confuſion in what is ſaid by <hi>T. M.</hi> hereabout, but they have miſ-related his ſayings, and therefore tax them becauſe they agree not with their Errors concerning mans natural ſinfulneſs called Original ſin, and the humanity of Chriſt denied by them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>John Horn</hi> (they ſay) holds, that they that had no guile in them, had ſin in them, that every ſin is not guile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tis well they dared not to put in <hi>David</hi> with him, as holding the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for he ſays that man is <hi>bleſſed whoſe ſins are covered, and to whom the Lord will not impute ſin, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile;</hi> ſo then it ſeems ſome men in whoſe ſpirit is no guile have ſins in them, though covered, and not imputed to them, there needs no cover for what is not, yet <hi>John Horn</hi> did not ſay that every one that had no guile in him had ſin in him, for he excepts Jeſus Chriſt who neither did ſin, nor had guile in him, not that Principle then; but the contradiction of it is the Error.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>T. M.</hi> (ſay they affirmed) That the blood of Chriſt ſhed is not in his perſon in heaven, but the vertue of it: To which <hi>T. M.</hi> ſaith:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That herein alſo they have altered and falſified his ſayings, which in Anſwer to their Queſtion where the blood of Chriſt is, was to this effect: That the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood was ſhed, and the vertue or preciouſneſs thereof; or of his bloodſhedding is now with the Father in the perſon of Chriſt in Heaven, foraſmuch as by means, and for the worth thereof, he is raiſed from the dead, and entred into heaven it ſelf, there to appear in the preſence of God for us, having by it obtained life from the dead, even eternal life, and redemption for us. Mind alſo Reader that they ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 15. that they blame us not, nor did blame us for not aſſerting that the bloodſhed is in the body of Chriſt: Why then note they this as a dangerous principle had <hi>T. M.</hi> ſo ſaid.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>T. M.</hi> (ſay they affirmed) That the blood of Chriſt ſhed is the foundation of their faith, but where it is they anſwered not, nor could they tell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The forementioned Anſwer to their Queſtion, was firſt often given and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, elſe what meant their reply to it to this effect: That the vertue of a thing cannot be ſeparated from the thing it ſelf, that it may be where the thing it ſelf is not in a preſent, reall, ſenſible exiſtence, or being; the contrary to which was then proved, as is ſhewed in the Book they pretend to anſwer: And further <hi>T. M.</hi> his Aſſertion was, That as the blood of Chriſt is in heaven with the Father in the ſenſe above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſo its the ground and foundation of our Faith, it being that by means of which he is ſo, and ſo we ſtill ſay that the blood or ſufferings of Chriſt, and he through and by means thereof being raiſed from the dead, and glorified in the ſame body in which he bare our ſins (without which his ſufferings could have done us no good) is the foundation of our faith; it ſeems it is not of theirs, and ſo they have not faith in his blood as the Apoſtles preached, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.) their faith is founded in ſomething elſe, and ſo they are men of dangerous Principles, beware of them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>T. M.</hi> They further ſay affirmed, That the life of Chriſt is not in the blood of Chriſt (whence they infer that) the Foundation of our faith hath not the life of Chriſt in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This alſo is a deceitful abuſe and falſifying of his words which were in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their aſſertion, That the blood of Chriſt is nothing elſe but the life of Chriſt, the Spirit or power of God, bringing thoſe Scriptures for proof, that ſpeaking
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110170:13"/>
not ſo much as of man in his mortal ſtate, but of other mortal creatures, ſay the blood is the life, and the life of the fleſh is in the blood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which <hi>T. M.</hi> ſaid, that the life of Chriſts perſonal body (which body they deny) is not in or by the ſupply of material blood, as the life of mortal creatures, yet he ſaid that the eternal life and redemption in Chriſt for us is the fruit of his blood, being obtained by it: So that their concluſion hath not the leaſt colour from his ſaying, but is contradicted by it, for the material blood that was ſhed as to its preſent locallity or place of being, as to its matter is not the foundation of our faith in whole or in part; but his bloodſhed or ſufferings to the pouring out his ſoul to death for our ſins, and he by vertue thereof, as is before ſaid.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>T. M.</hi> affirmed (ſay they again) that the light wherewith Chriſt lighteth every man is both natural and ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That Chriſt is the true light that lighteth every man coming into the world, and that the light which he giveth or wherewith he lighteth them, is all that is truly called light and good, whether natural or ſpiritual, we did and do aſſert as truth; their denial of which implies an evil Principle held by them, <hi>Viz.</hi> That they deprive Chriſt of the glory of being the Author and giver either of the natural light or good, or of the ſpiritual.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>T. M.</hi> ſay they, ſaid, That the perſon of Chriſt (namely of fleſh and bones) is a quickning ſpirit, and dwells in the beleevers by faith, and to prove it he ſaid that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> dwelt in the heart of <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There again they falſifie and pervert his ſayings, which were that the perſon of Chriſt that had and hath fleſh and bones (a perſon of fleſh and bones we call him not; thats the term they put upon him by way of deriſion and reproach) even Jeſus Chriſt, who was made of <hi>the ſeed of David according to the fleſh, is declared to be the Son of God with power, by the reſurrection from the dead,</hi> even in the ſame body in which he bare our ſins on the tree, and he the ſecond man, the laſt <hi>Adam</hi> is made a <hi>quickning ſpirit;</hi> which was anſwered againſt their ſeeking privily to inſinuate to the people, that that body of his fleſh was aboliſhed or annihilated, ſo that now he hath not that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or poſſeſſes not his glory therein, to ſhew the vanity and wickedneſs of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, wherein it was urged, that the manhood or body of his fleſh is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated by his becomming a quickning Spirit, it being the man Chriſt Jeſus the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> thats made a quickning Spirit; yea, its becauſe this man continues for ever in the name &amp; glory of the Father for us, that he hath an unchangeable Prieſthood, and <hi>is able to ſave to the utmoſt them that come to God by him;</hi> God having given to the Son of man to have life in himſelf even as the Son hath life in himſelf. As to the other part of the charge, <hi>T. M.</hi> his ſaying was, that its the man Chriſt Jeſus as thus conſidered as a diſtinct perſon, perſonally or bodily diſtant from them (ſo as they are abſent from him while they are at home in the mortal body) that is and dwels in the beleevers heart by faith. To their ſenſual ſcoffing at which, as not being able to comprehend by their ſenſual imagination how ſuch a thing might be, ſuch matters of faith being too high for them (as even the leaſt things in the wiſedome of God are too high for a fool that ſeeks to be wiſe in himſelf) we brought that of the <hi>Corinths</hi> and the <hi>Philippians</hi> being in the Apoſtles hearts by love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 7. not to prove that Chriſt dwells in the beleevers hearts by faith, thats fully and plainly the aſſertion of the Scripture, and needs no other proof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. But for illuſtration and diſcovery
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110170:13"/>
of the thing to the weakeſt of them whom they indeavoured to ſubvert, to ſhew them how one might dwell in the heart of another, and yet be perſonally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and as to bodily preſence diſtant alſo, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p>But mind Reader, that theſe men do flatly oppoſe the dwelling of the man Chriſt as a quickning ſpirit in the hearts of the beleevers by Faith, which had they not been blinded with Antichriſtian Babiloniſh confuſion, they would not have done plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein without covert contradicting the Spirit in the Apoſtle, that with ſo great earneſtneſs prayed for the <hi>Epheſians, That Chriſt might dwell in their hearts by faith;</hi> but its manifeſt that theſe men know not what faith is, but take it for a beleeving ſomething of God or Chriſt, from a knowing or experimenting it in themſelves as <hi>the Devils believe,</hi> James 2. 19. Which yet is not faith or having faith, and their after abuſe of, and clipping, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. in their <hi>p.</hi> 1. Gives occaſion to think they take it ſo; or for ſenſe or ſight as many of their words import, but did they know that believing is the receiving a thing from a report, and that every believing is not faith in Scripture account, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11.

If yes, then will we be counted contradictors of our ſelves alſo with him; if no, then neither do we contradict our ſelves; but either they are ignorant of the nature of contradictions, and ſo not perfect; or elſe knowingly ſay falſly, and ſo are vitious: We then yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what they maintain a great Error, and yet ſay what the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid not what they ſay, that he that is born of God hath no ſin in him, but on the contrary, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin in us, we deceive our ſelves,</hi> and yet they were born of God, ſure they beleeved Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and <hi>whoſoever doth ſo is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 1. ſo that any that are not blind may ſee the confuſion and deceit in themſelves that they would perſwade them they may ſee in us, and we have not broken our ſelves (as they ſay falſly of us) againſt any ſtone, nor can any ſtone we war againſt in them break us, being but ſuch as are to be removed out of Gods Vineyard, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. 2. they adde:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> 
                  <q>If Chriſt be made manifeſt to take away ſin then they in whom he is made manifeſt are not to have ſin in them; ſo long as they are in this life, and if he that is born of God cannot ſin nor yield up to ſin, then he is not a ſinner but clear and perfect from ſin.</q> 
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> We deny theſe inferences; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have ſpoken to and diſproved above, to the former we ſay, I'ts not their duty to have ſin as their phraſe may ſeem to imply: Nor do we ſay it is their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but their infirmity; even as to be weak and mortall is not their duty, but their burthen, but if by [are to have ſin in them] they mean they have or will have ſin in them ſo long as they are in this life; we deny that inference till they prove that Chriſt was manifeſted to take away ſin, ſo as to take it wholly out of the nature of man in ſome of the particular perſons in this life, and that too abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falibly; we are not to build our faith upon their inferences, but upon Gods ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and God by his Apoſtle ſaith not Chriſt was manifeſted to take away ſin,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:16"/>
therefore in us is no ſin as their Inference imports; therefore their Inference is denied by us; nor ſlumble we, much leſs do we break our ſelves at that ſtone: They adde, <q>Whoſoever ſinneth hath neither ſeen Chriſt nor known him; now they that affirm that the Saints or they that be born of God are ſinners they might as well ſay that the Saints have neither ſeen Chriſt nor known him.</q> 
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> True if by ſaying they are ſinners they mean they be in their ſins, and live in their ſins, he that ſo ſinneth hath neither ſeen him nor known him, but to be in ſin and to have ſin in men, to live in ſin, and to have ſailings or be overtaken with faults as, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. Are very different things, and in ſuch ſenſe he that ſaies the Saints are ſinners that is have ſin in them, and in ſome things, offend, doth not all one as to ſay they have not ſeen or known Chriſt; a man may be a ſinner by having ſin in him and yet not ſin, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 20. <hi>Paul</hi> did not the evil, yet ſaies, of whom (namely of ſinners) I am the chief, by your inference <hi>Paul</hi> might have ſaid he neither had ſeen Chriſt nor known him; and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> might have ſaid, I a man of polluted lips therefore mine eyes never ſee the Lord of hoſts, whereas he ſayes the contrary, for mine eyes have ſeen the King the Lord of hoſts, which he ſpoke of Chriſt when he ſaw his glory, <hi>Iſa</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12, 41. See Reader how there runs a conſtant ſtreame of miſtake in all their writings.</p>
               <p>To thoſe phraſes, He that is born of God cannot ſin, we ſaid it's no more then to ſay that a man acted of God cannot therein ſin. To this they ſay, <q>It's no more then to ſay that a man acted of God cannot ſin in being acted of God; or he that doth righteouſneſs doth not ſin in ſo doing.</q>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Yes it's ſome thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> That mens ſinnings are not of God nor can be, and ſo that they that ſin do not do righteouſneſs nor are born or acted of God thereunto; contrary to many that pretend that whatever they do they are led of God thereunto, even then when they ſin, and to that purpoſe. I was told by one (whether it be true I know not) that ſome of the Quakers ſhould ſay, that what ever they do after they are believers or born of God (in their ſenſe) they cannot ſin in it: the Apoſtle Argues the root from the fruit, as in <hi>James</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted I am tempted of God, for God is not tempted with evill nor tempts he any mans but a man is tempted when led away by his own lusts,</hi> &amp;c. As for reſerving an accuſation againſt him thats born of God, as they charge us it's anſwered before we accuſe not whom God juſtifies, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict we what <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous as God is righteous,</hi> for he ſaith not he that doth righteouſneſs is as righteous as God is righteous in whom there is no ſin; ſimilitude there is but not perfect equality, yea therefore is righteous as Chriſt is righteous, not becauſe there is no ſin in him, but becauſe Chriſt is made to him of God his righteouſneſs; and in him he is righteous as Chriſt is righteouſnot in himſelf through Chriſt as ighteous as Chriſt is in reſpect of being without ſin, they adde <q>See here how they have accuſed the Apoſtle <hi>Paul I.

For though he did not ſin ſo groſly as before, yet he was ſtill the ſame ſinner or ſinfull man that Chriſt came to ſave, yea, and might poſſibly account every ſmall neglect or failing a greater ſin now then his greateſt ſins before; becauſe ſenſible now of his more ingagement to Chriſt for his having ſhewed him ſuch favour, a ſmaller offence againſt greater knowledge and mercy, may be greater then a greater ſin againſt leſs knowledge and mercy, however what he ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> we proved and prove yet from the Text, that is, that he ſaid of himſelf even then when an Apoſtle, that then, in the preſent tenſe, he was a chief ſinner, if he ſaid falſely of himſelf, then was he therein a ſinner; if true, then have not we ſaid falſely of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor accuſed him.</p>

They ſay is not every ſin deceit, and deceit guile. Anſwer, every ſin is not that which is called deceit or fraud, nor every deceit guile, there is ſin of ignorance and miſtake without intention to deceive, or double heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs or deceit fulneſs of heart, when a thing is not known to a man; a man would do better if he knew, as when <hi>Paul</hi> reviled the high Prieſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. And ſo that ruler of his people, it was not deceit his ſo doing, or out of a mind to do deceitfuly, but out of miſtake or ignorance, nor was it ſin that he was deceived in his thoughts about him (for it is no ſin for a man not to know the Perſon of another that he knows not) but his raſhneſs and reviling him as he did though miſtaking him was his ſin, ſo that neither was that his ſin guile nor was his being deceived about his Perſon or Office his ſin, much leſs guile, in him; Let the underſtanding judge of what is ſaid.</p>

Laying eſide all malice and all guile (Mark all guile) and hypocrifie: the word (and) being his diſtinction he might as well ſay envy is not malice becauſe there is (and) between them.</q> To which <hi>Iohn Horn</hi> replies. 1. Why ſay they Mark all guile, doth the ſaying all guile make it to be all ſin, no ſin but guile? Why then [all malice] ſhould be Marked too, that thats all ſin, and ſo no ſin of ignorance, but all ſin is malice, becauſe its ſaid all malice, and by the ſame reaſon becauſe its ſaid <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 31. All bitterneſs; bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs too ſhould be all ſin. 2. Why Mark all guile, rather then Mark, and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, as diſtinguiſhing hypocriſy from guile, for (and) uſes to couple things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed moſt uſually. 3. Why ſay they the word (and) is my diſtinction, when it was the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> too as well as mine. 4. I may ſay that envy is not all malice; though it have malice in it, yet malice may be without it in ſome caſes. I may ſay my elbow is not my arm though it be in my arm, ſo I may ſay envy is not malice though malice be in it; there is a diſtinction between them, envy is a looking at anothers proſperity with grief at it, malice is an evill will towards a Perſon; whence envy proceeds, you adde. <q>That in that thing many ſee my folly at the diſpute in affirming that all ſin is not guile, when as all guile

They ſay falſly in ſaying many ſee my folly at the diſpute in ſaying all ſin is not guile; for how is that folly that ſtands againſt all their deceit, ſome poſſibly might not underſtand the truth of what I ſaid through their own folly, but that any could ſee my folly in what it was not to be ſeen is impoſſible. I am ſure divers ſee their folly in affirming all ſin to be guile, and the ſorry waies they took to prove it, and that they may ſee yet, for. 2. When as all guile (they ſay) doth onely include one ſin as I would have it, then it is as I would have it, it ſeems; and then where is the folly to be ſeen but in them that charge me with it; and then, ſay it is as I would have it, but I ſuppoſe the word (not) is omitted in the printing, for I will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious though to an adverſary, they ſhould have ſaid all guile doth not onely include one ſin as I would have it, but if that be their minde, yet they bely me in ſaying I would have all guile include but one ſin; I would rather ſay it is one ſpring or kind of ſin, and is included in many or divers ſins and yet is not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſins in which it is, nor is it included in every ſin, much leſs includes it all ſin no more then all malice or all bitterneſs includes all ſins, becauſe they include di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers acts of ſin. 3. When they ſay (any one ſin makes a man guilty, and ſo he hath guile in him) they ſpeak very ignorantly or very guilefully (for I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them) ignorantly if they think guile and guilt of one denomination, and guilty to come from the word (guile) and ſo all that makes guilty, to make guily. Guilty is ſaid of guilt, I trow, and not of guile, though guile produces guilt, yet a man is not denominated guilty from guile but from guilt, and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full from guile. If they know not this; they are very ignorant and not perfect in knowledge and then they are wretchedly unhappy that take them for Oracles that are ſo ignorant. If they know this, then dealt they guilfully and intended to deceive ſimple ignorant people that cannot diſtinguiſh things that differ, by their Sophiſtry: and then the caſe of their followers is yet more wretched, which things being ſo. 4.

Nor is all perfectiom, perfection of ſinleſneſs in mens ſelves; <hi>Aſa</hi> was perfect hearted all his daies and yet had ſin and ſinned, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17. and 16. 9. <hi>And yet every one that is perfect ſhall be as his Lord,</hi> he ſaies not he is ſo; yea in ſaying he ſhall be, he implies he is not yet ſo: but when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him: for we ſhall ſee him as he is. This we granted: but they skipt it over. 4. The Apoſtle ſaid, they were circumciſed with the circumciſiou made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands in the putting off the body of ſins of the fleſh: but it was in Chriſt he ſaies, for ſo much the words [in whom] ſignifies. And the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10. 11: to the ſame people therefore he ſaith, but now you alſo (Mark now alſo) put off all theſe, anger, wrath, malice, blaſphemy, filthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, &amp;c. <hi>Col</hi> 3. 8, 9. it ſeems then they had thoſe things yet to put off ſtill: for can any put off what is not? So to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> too, when he had ſaid they had learned to put off the old man and put on the new; he addes, wherefore: putting away lying, ſpeak every man truth to his brother; a leſſon theſe men have not yet learned. To the <hi>Corimbians</hi> alſo he ſaith: purge out the old leaven that

ye may be a new lump even as ye are unleavened, ſo that in ſome ſenſe (in Chriſt) they were unleavened, and yet in other ſenſe needed to purge out the old leaven, which implies it was yet in them, for how can a man purge that out of him that is not in him; but they through ignorance confound theſe things, and run themſelves and Auditors into deluſion.</p>
               <p>Again p. 5. l. 36. They diſtinguiſh the true Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles from themſelves that are accuſed by us, and ſo again imply, that they be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true Chriſt, nor his true Prophets or Apoſtles. Reader, mind it, they give out themſelves for Prophets and Apoſtles; and ſome of them ſay they are Chriſt, but they are falſe ones, and why then plead they for their falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyings and witneſſings! But they indeed ſhew their confuſion and rayling againſt us, as after will appear to their own delection and ſhame, as for their innocence, no liers are innocent but they be over and over proved liers, that perfect heartedneſs, and compleateneſs in Chriſt may conſiſt with ſin being in men in this life we have ſhewed. And they cannot diſprove unloſs they will blot out, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. with Chap. 3. 8. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17. ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. 9. Which we noted above, either let them ſay thoſe Scripture ſayings are falſe, or elſe own their own words to be falſe, in ſaying that <q>we fight againſt our own words,</q> and that <q>they that are compleate in Chriſt are perfectly freed from ſin (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as to all inherency of it in themſelves, or they ſay nothing to purpoſe;</q> that <q>ſinners are out of the compleatneſs of Chriſt</q> (which though in ſome ſenſe true, <hi>viz.</hi> Of ſinners out of Chriſt, yet is not univerſally true, except <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaid of ſinners I am the chief, was out of Chriſts compleatneſs) that <q>the heart that hath ſin dwelling in it is not perfect,</q> contrary to, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17. with 16, 17. Where <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> heart is ſaid to have been perfect all his daies, and yet he is charged with relying on the King of <hi>Aſyria,</hi> and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the Lord his God, and thoſe were heart-ſins, ſurely, and they dwell there too for ſome time, as the <hi>verſes</hi> before manifeſt.</p>
               <p>p. 6. <q>They accuſe us of confuſion, that we ſay believers are come to a further ſtate and covenant then <hi>Adam</hi> was in before his fall; who then had no ſin in him and yet accuſe the believers (they ſay) with having the body of ſin, or not being perfect while here.</q>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Here they ſhew their own confuſion for the believers being in a better ſtate or convenant in Chriſt, hinders not their having ſin yet in themſelves to purge out, as is evident in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10, 11. with 3. 5. 8, 9. No more then it hinders them from having infirmides and death which <hi>Adam</hi> unfallen had not, beſides they have added a lie or two, as that we accuſe the believers with having a body of ſin, then <hi>Paul</hi> accuſed them when he ſaid the believers old man is crucified with Chriſt that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, the words (might be) plainly imply it a thing not then done but to be done, as in all like expreſſions is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that we accuſe them with not being perfect when in divers reſpects we grant them to be perfect, as perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, and many of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with Chriſt in their Spirits without guile there, and perfect comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſome others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the ſame page they wrong us in giving it as our ſaying <q>that <hi>Adam</hi> might poſſibly ſin and die but not ſo the believers,</q> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we added what they ſuppreſs to not ſo the believer; not under a covenant of

works here: nor hereafter the reſurrection capable of ſinning, and dying as <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall was, again they ſay, we would accuſe the Quakers of being ſinners becauſe of their dying, which is falſe, let any man read our book, p 3. What we ſaid is thus, that the Quakers are not in <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate before the fall, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had no death, then upon him as the Quakers have, for they muſt die; but they ſay, <q>here our darkneſs appears, for believers dying the natural death doth not prove them ſinners while here, for through death they gain more of the peace and glory of God; which they partake of in their life time,</q> which is both confuſed and inconcludent, for what if the believer gain by his death, may it not therefore argue he had ſin in him while he lived; is not the being freed from the body of death, and inherency and combating with ſin again think they? Though we did not bring it for an argument to prove what they charge us with as we before diſcovered, and for their confuſion, their words ſound as if they believed that the greater gain by their death they have it all in this live; for they ſay not more of the peace and glory of God then they partake of in this life, but which they partake of in this life, but where can they ſhew us any that ever died that either had not ſin in him or ſin imputed to him.</p>
               <p>They imply p. 6. l. 25, 26. By their taxing us with the contrary <q>that <hi>Adam</hi> might have died the naturall death if he had not ſinned, and to prove it adde, for Chriſt died who had no ſin.</q> To which we reply. 1. Did Chriſt die a naturall death; was it naturall to Chriſt to die. 2. Had Chriſt no ſin of ours upon him which occaſioned his death! or ſhould he have died though he had not them, laid upon him? He bare our ſins in his own body on the tree therefore he had ſins though none of his own, he did no ſin neither was guile found in his mouth (ſee there guile and ſin diſtinguiſhed, as if all ſin is not guile, or guile not all ſin) yet he bare our ſins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22, 24. 3. Is this a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, Chriſt died that did not ſin; yet had our ſins charged or laid upon him, therfore <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have died a natural death though he had not ſinned, let the reader judge, they ſay <q>Chriſt died to deſtroy the death that came by ſin.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. If death came by ſin, as the Apoſtle teſtifies in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. What death was that if not the naturall death! Or where doth the Apoſtle diſtinguiſh and ſay, there is a death of men that came in by ſin, and the death of men that came not in by ſin, and that's the natural death? Or where find we mention of <hi>Adams</hi> dying before and without reſpect to his ſinning in any kind of death. 2. Did not Chriſt by death deſtroy the naturall death, both in taking away its force for taking us out of favour and fellowſhip with God, and in becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection and life from death by whom men ſhall be raiſed up out of it at the laſt day? Did he not deſtroy that kind of death which he died; and if that was the naturall death, as they ſay, the bodily death, we may ſay then that he alſo deſtroyed: and ſo deſtroying that death that came in by ſin, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the naturall or bodily death came in by ſin too; and ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not have died had he not ſinned. Do they think that we will worſhip them and call them the maſters of our faith to receive their dictates without proof? Let them ſhew that <hi>Adam</hi> might have died the natural death, or the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers either, if they had not ſinned.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> True, but its by vertue of the Lord in whom they die, that turns their curſes into bleſſings; death into life. Nor is it natural to die in the Lord, though to die be. Its true too <q>[that the righteous mens dying was not charged upon them as a reward for their ſin]</q> and yet true too that had they never been ſinners or ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> they had never died, for as much as by one mans ſin, death paſſed upon all as the Apoſtle witneſſes, as a reward of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin and theirs in him it firſt was denounced, and though through Chriſt the weight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiveneſs of it is removed yet the carcaſs of it remains upon men generally, though through Chriſt turned to the believers gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> They ſay, <q>God ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die, but <hi>Adam</hi> loſt not his naturall life in the day he eat of the tree of knowledge: for after that he lived in the body.</q>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Herein again they ſhew their confuſion, for what though <hi>Adam</hi> lived in the body after he eat of the tree of knowledge, follows it he had not loſt his life, that day he eat? A man my looſe or forfeit that which may not preſently be taken from him: men looſe their lives in a Law ſenſe when they do ſuch things as ſubject them to the Law, ſo as they are thereby condemned to die; though death be not preſently executed upon them. That day he died then in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law though not as to its execution upon him, which yet had been then executed too, its probable, had not Chriſt the Mediator interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and death to die for him.

               <p>
                  <q>They ſay, The covenant <hi>Adam</hi> was in before his fall, was a covenant of life: for he was in the image of God and a living ſoul; having the breath of life in him and had dominion in it, while he ſtood in his habitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But they have weakly proved that it is ſo: for ſure the covenant made with him was with him alive and as a creature, and not made with him before he was a living man, and therefore his being in the image of God, a living ſoul, having the breath of life in him and dominion in it, as they ſpeak, are not to the purpoſe. The covenat might concern their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance to him, not his being made firſt in them; <q>they adde, this ſtate have the believers proved and witneſſed, that life and nature and image that was in man before the fall, though they become further in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> who is greater then the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Still they dictate magiſterially; where have the believers proved that ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> and witneſs it, let them ſhew it in all the Scriptures: for as for their witneſſings they are of no Authority with us, its the truth of their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings we would have them prove and not onely tell us they are true, for we are not of the mind with ſome ſimple that believe every of their words, to believe that their ſayings are as good or better then the ſayings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtle in the Scriptures, have any believers, ever witneſſed that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110170:23"/>
they were without ſin as <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; under no more ſentence of death, then <hi>Adam</hi> while in his innocent condition, let them ſhew us that, that we may believe it, have any believers proved that ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> to have life in themſelves and not in Chriſt crucified as <hi>Adam</hi> had?

               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> The miſtake of this is ſhewed above, in that that covenant was not for the firſt giving, but for the continuance of his life in the favour of God and that (though he could not merit by any works and obedience) was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upon his working, that that was good ſinleſly, otherwiſe he was to die, as appeared in that he loſt it by his ſinning and fell under death, from which that covenant afforded no Redemption as the covenant in Chriſt doth; ſo that we have not ſpoken ignorantly as they charge us, but the ignorance is found with them, that confound what covenant <hi>Adam</hi> was under with what was given to the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for convincement of their ſin when fallen. The covenant of works or Law as given to fallen man in the hand of a Mediator entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of tranſgreſſion till the ſeed came, and ſo was given with ſubordination to the covenant of grace, even the grace of God in the Redeemer from the fall and the death that came by ſin; as the naturall death alſo did: though they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly imply the contrary, and no marvaile for if that death be by ſin, then there muſt be a Redemption out of that death; and ſo a Reſurrection of the body from it: which ſeeing they deny how can they grant it comes in by ſin, and that the ſeed ſhould Redeem the creature out of it? So that herein alſo their iniquity and corrupt judgement is ſeen and the root of their deniall that the naturall death came in by ſin; namely their deniall of the Redemption by Chriſt from that death and ſo the Reſurrection of the body from it as after will more appear, ſo that here Reader we have a complication of errours in them. Thus much to their defence of their firſt errour about their ſinleſneſs, let us ſee how they defend their ſecond.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond charge of them was about the perſonall body of Chriſt, in which he ſuffered, which that it is aſcended into Heaven, the Heavens without all men and above the clouds oppoſed to the viſible earth, we ſay they would not be brought to acknowledge; touching which whether we queſtioned ſeverall times altering our words as they charge us, let them judge that read our book. But they ſay, <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi>

                  <q>It appears we hold Chriſt hath two bodies in telling of a myſticall body, and not receiving that as in anſwer, that his body is the Church the fulneſs of him, that filleth all in all, and in that from our words (they ſay) we would have Chriſt to have a body beſides or diſtinct from the fulneſs of God, when as the Scripture doth not ſay that Chriſt hath two bodies, or that his body is a body of fleſh and bones without the blood in it, as they ſay we told them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> See here Reader, did we ignorantly charge them, that by the body they ſaid was glorified in Heaven, they meant his Church; do not they here ſpeak it out while they tax us with holding Chriſt hath two bodies, becauſe we ſay he hath his perſonall body in which he ſuffered, and which he ſhewed to have fleſh and bones in it, as a Spirit hath not. And is it more abſurd for Chriſt to have in two ſenſes, a body or two bodies in different ſenſes of the word body, then for the believer to have two heads in two diſtinct ſenſes; hath not <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and the reſt, each of them their perſonall head in which they have tongues with which they ſmite them that are more righteous then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? And if they were believers in truth, ſhould they not have Chriſt for their head too? And why then may not Chriſt have a body of his own as a man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, in which he ſhewed his Diſciples fleſh and bones; and yet have a body myſticall, or body ſignifying a Church, ſociety or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as he is the Ruler and Governour of them and in them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? And doth not the Scripture ſet forth both theſe to us as diſtinct bodies, though thoſe very words two bodies it hath not; was it his body the Church in which he ſhewed his Diſciples his fleſh and bones, hands and feet that were pierced with Nailes, and in which he bare our ſins on the tree? And was it his perſonal body for which <hi>Paul</hi> filled up the remainder of the ſufferings. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. Is there not expreſly the body of his fleſh mentioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. In which he reconciled us to God (his now glorious body in the Heavens to which the body of his Church is to be faſhioned into the likeneſs of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. 21.) And the body his Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. See here how theſe men broadly deny Chriſt as man, and onely make him a Spirit filling the Church, and ſo the Spirit and the Church to be Chriſt and is not that all the Chriſt they confeſs now to be?

                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> They would have ſtopt ſure at [the Spirits of all men] but that they love to be in the clouds, that their meaning may be taken out of the ſimples ſight. They adde that [as he is diſtinct from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bodies] to cover over a lie with the face of truth, and blind men with the ſhew of an Anſwer, when as in truth it's none: for our Queſtion was not whether Chriſts body be diſtinct from the Spirits of all men in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as from carnall bodies; but whether the body they ſpeak of [rather] be diſtinct from both of them, be the manner what it will; To their additionall falſhood [as we imagine] as if we imagined it diſtinct from them both after the ſame manner, we ſay, it's as truely diſtinct from the one as from the other, but not after the ſame ſort; it differs from the carnall bodies of men in carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and groſneſs and corruptibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It differs from the Spirits of men in ſubſtance, it's a body and they are Spirits; yet it is diſtinct from both of them becauſe neither are they it, nor it they, but let us view their reaſon for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſtinction between them. They ſay, <q>The Sperits of juſt men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rejoyce in him.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Who do they rejoyce in? In his body or not; for we are ſpeaking of the diſtinctneſs of his body from their Spirits, if they and their Spirits be his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how rejoyce they in his body? Do they rejoyce in themſelves; or is there another body for them to rejoyce in, beſides themſelves that rejoyce all of them in Union? They ſay, <q>The true Church in Chriſt which diſcerns his body in his fulneſs is but one compleat body in the fulneſs of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Here they are in the clouds indeed, but clouds of darkneſs, his light is not ſpread upon them, for, 1. What difference is there between the true Church that diſcerns, and his body diſcerned by it; if as they ſaid before his body is his Church, and we read not of two bodies of Chriſt? If none, then his Church diſcerns its ſelf and rejoyces in it ſelf: and the Church that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it ſelf is one compleat body in the fulneſs of God (before it was the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, &amp; now it is in the fulneſs of God; but the Scripture ſaies neither of it) if the Church which is his body ſee or diſcern another body of Chriſt beſides itſelf, then they muſt ſay too, there are two bodies of Chriſt, one that diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and another that is diſcerned by it, which they before denied and reaſoned againſt; what confuſion are they herein? By which we are ſo far from knowing, that they own what the Scriptures do declare concerning Chriſt and his body, as they ſay of themſelves, that we hereby know them to be they that do not own it, and we will diſcern notwithſtanding their palliating over the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with ſubtile expreſſions, as <q>[That the ſame that deſcended into the lower parts of the earth; is he that aſcended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things, the ſame Chriſt that ſuffered in the body at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in divers forms after the Reſurrection, in the transfiguration before, the ſame aroſe again, and was taken in his aſcending out of the ſight of them that gazed after him; and is glorified in the ſame glory which he had with

the Father before the world was]</q> yet we ſee your deceit, that in all this you yet deny that body that he ſuffered in to be now in glory, that perſonal body that had fleſh and bones in it, and therefore that you believe not what was ſaid to thoſe you reproach for gazing after him, that he ſhould even ſo come again in like manner as they had ſeen him go up into Heaven; for that was in a body with fleſh and bones in it, and was viſible to the eye till a cloud received him out from their ſight: and that this you deny, appears in what you have ſaid before of the Church being his body onely, and by what follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That <q>[as he who is the Word became fleſh, ſo when the days of his fleſh were finiſhed, he was tranſlated into his own glory which he had with his Father from eternity; and ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quickning Spirit]</q> for in thoſe words you imply that his fleſh, or the ſubſtance of his body in which he bare our ſins is ceaſed, and ſo that his humanity, or what he took of the Virgin, and of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> after the fleſh is gone, ſo as he is onely a Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any human body: but how then did the Apoſtle oppoſe Chriſt in his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into Heaven unto <hi>David? Acts</hi> 2. 34, 45. For by that <hi>David</hi> aſcended as much as Chriſt, for his Spirit went to God when his body went to the duſt, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7. And it ſeems by your ſayings, Chriſts body is not aſcended, but by the Apoſtles ſaying, Chriſt is oppoſed to <hi>David</hi> in aſcending in what he [<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>] aſcended not, whoſe body he ſays is the ſepulchre; therefore it follows, that the body of Chriſt is aſcended, and is taken up into glory, and is called the glorious body of Chriſt to which the believers body is to be conformed and changed into its likeneſs; not into the Churches likeneſs ſure, which as yet is much of it in a ſuffering ſtate, and not a glorious body; yea, the Apoſtle tells us, that of the fruit of <hi>Davids</hi> loines according to the fleſh Chriſt is raiſed up to ſit upon his throne, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 30. Is he the man Jeſus, the Mediator of God and us, the propitiation for our ſins as a Spirit merely! Or is he the man Chriſt as he is God in us, or a Spirit in Union with his Church? And is ſo as he, the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins; then he bare his own ſins in his body, and is the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for himſelf; ſeeing the Church is he or part of him, his body that was offered up for us. It's true, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was made a quickning Spirit, yet abides a man, and hath a glorious body dictinct from his Church, to which our body is to be conformed; even as <hi>Adam</hi> was a living ſoul yet had a natural body.</p>

                  <q>Whether we believe that body the ſaints upon earth do diſcern, and which the world cannot diſcern is a body of fleſh and bones, yea or nay.]</q> We anſwer, it's the body that was broken for us, and is to be fed upon by us, as is plain in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. 29. [not diſcerning the Lords body] it's that that is remembred and communicated with in the ſupper of the Lord which ordinance you have denied in your queries to us, and that body was the ſame that Chriſt ſhewed to have fleſh and bones in it; and in which he went up into Heaven, as before, think you the Church was given and broken for us: and is the breaking of the Church that which we are to have communion with, and remember as the matter of our ſeeding in that Ordinance? Though the body myſticall of Chriſt his Church,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:26"/>
is alſo to be diſcerned by the believers and is not by the world: but if the Church be the body diſcerned which in the ſupper we have the communion of, and which was broken for us; then the fleſh of Chriſt which we eat is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Church, the fleſh and ſubſtance of the Church, and ſo the Church is to eate itſelf; what confuſed ſtuff is this that is inſinuated by you to us? But by the reaſon you give off your propounding that queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>[ſeeing we own the believers or Church to be the body of Chriſt, and plead for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body of Chriſt diſtinct from them]</q> it's plain without contradiction that you deny the perſonall body of Chriſt to be, and abide in the Heavens; and to deny the man Jeſus to be the Object of the believers faith, and why ſhamed you to ſpeak out this ſo broadly at the diſpute? Was you then more baſhfull, and are ſince grown more audacious and impudent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> They ſay, <q>It's groſſe confuſion to ſay, that believers are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts fleſh and bones, and then to ſay, they are not fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone: as if Chriſt had two bodies of fleſh and bone, one of which the ſaints are not Members, when the Apoſtle ſays as much as they were fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone, in ſaying no man ever hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth it and cheriſheth it; even as the Lord the Church: for we are Members of his body of his fleſh and of his bones, <bibl>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Surely the groſſe confuſion is clearly in themſelves here as is eaſie to demonſtrate. 1. They bely us, in ſaying of us that we ſaid, what we ſaid not, <hi>viz.</hi> That believers are Members of Chriſts fleſh and bones; we ſaid, the Apoſtles preached that the believers are Members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones, neither the Greek nor the Latine (as <hi>G. W.</hi> At leaſt as to the Latine may know) will bear that conſtruction, Members of his fleſh and bones, but Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body; of (that is out of) his fleſh, and of (or out of) his bones, <hi>ex carne ejus &amp; ex oſſibus ejus.</hi> 2. Is his Church fleſh and bones? ſaid they not above that a body of fleſh and bones, cannot be ſaid to be in the Heavens, but if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers be a body of fleſh and bones, as they are if they be fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, muſt they not needs be then a body of fleſh and bones in Heaven; ſeeing they grant his body to be in the heavens, yea to be the fulneſs of God that filleth all in all both in Heaven and earth; is fleſh and bones the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God filling all in all both in Heaven and earth? 'Tis true that the Church conſiſts of Members, that each of them have perſonall heads and bodies of fleſh and bones as men, but are they fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone? Is our fleſh of Chriſts fleſh, and our bone of Chriſts bone? How then hath not Chriſt fleſh and bone of his own, diſtinct from the body his Church, if our fleſh be fleſh of his fleſh, and our bone be bone of his bone? Doth not that phraſe ſpeak plainly of fleſh and bones of his, diſtinct from the Church, which they ſay too is fleſh and bone; is not the confuſion then in theſe men that deny Chriſt to have a body of fleſh and bones diſtinct from his Church, and then to ſay his Church is fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone, and ſo to imply a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the fleſh and bone that the Church is, and the fleſh and bone that it is of? As was between <hi>Evabs</hi> fleſh and bone, and the fleſhand bones of <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:110170:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out of which ſhe was made fleſh and bone; for to her that phraſe is applyed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. 3. Whereas they put this conſequent upon us that we by denying their addition to the Scriptures make it as if Chriſt had two bodies of fleſh and bones, one of which the ſaints are not Members, ſee if this follow not clearly from their addition? For whereas the Apoſtle ſays we are of his fleſh and of his bones, and ſo implies but one body of fleſh and bones out of which the Church is; now theſe to that body of fleſh and bones which is Chriſts, make a ſecond, which is the Church, while they ſay the Church is fleſh and bone too, fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone; even as <hi>Adams</hi> body of fleſh and bone out of which <hi>Eve</hi> was made, and <hi>Eves</hi> that was made out of it were two bodies of fleſh and bone. 4. Do they not bely the Apoſtle too when they ſay he ſaith as much as they were fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone; in his ſaying, <hi>no man ever hated his own fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but loveth it and cheriſheth it; even as the Lord the Church, for we are Members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones?</hi> Is it not clear that the former part ſpeaks of men loving their own naturall bodies cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their fleſh, but the latter part ſpeaks of Chriſt cheriſhing his Church, but calls not the Church his fleſh and bone, but Members of his body; of (that is out of) his fleſh, and of (that is out of) his bone, implying that the Church is ſprung and framed to him to be his Church out of his fleſh and bone, that is, from his incarnation, ſuffering, and the things done in and by his being made fleſh, had not he had a body prepared for him, even a body of fleſh and bones in which he did the Fathers will, he could have had no Church; we are the fruit of the travaile of his ſoul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10.</p>
               <p>We noted that this opinion of the Quakers denying that body, (<hi>viz.</hi> That body perſonall, that body that had fleſh and bones, and in which Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to be glorified, doth at once turn up by the roots all the faith of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Heavens for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>To this they Object again our confuſion and falſhood, becauſe we ſaid before of the Quakers, that the ſame body that ſuffered was glorified at Gods right hand in Heaven, and now charge them with denying that body to be glorified.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Mind here reader their ſubtilty, how they hide themſelves in aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, when we ſay they deny that body to be glorified; it is clear that we ſpeak of his body perſonall, the body of his fleſh: and doth it not plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they deny that to be glorified when they deny any body of Chriſt remaining but his Church? But now when they ſaid the ſame body that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was glorified, we told you before they meant but his Church, and ſo that body they that confeſs to ſuffer and to be glorified is not the ſame that we ſay they deny to be glorified, and to that purpoſe both in a letter we had from them, and in their book they tell us of the ſeed, Chriſt ſuffering ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where and in ſome, and reigning or glorified in others; were there ever ſuch juglers and Jeſuites as theſe we deal againſt, that are full of lies and confuſion, and wind about into many ſhapes and aequivocations to deceive the ſimple, but cannot be aſhamed of them, they are ſo hardened?</p>
               <p>They plainly ſhew their corrupt and wicked judgements about the coming

of the Lord from Heaven, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 15. While they ſay. <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> 
                  <q>we blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put it afar off, and that that coming of Chriſt the ſaints who were then alive (namely when the Apoſtles wrote) remained unto it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> So then by that the Lord himſelf deſcended from Heaven with a ſhout and with the voice of the Archangell, and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt were raiſed before <hi>Paul</hi> and the believing <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> dyed, and ſo they did not ſleep as to their bodies, but were ſuddenly changed and taken up to meet the Lord in the ayre, and to be ever with him; then thats falſe that Hyſtories relate of <hi>Pauls</hi> being beheaded at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in vain do men look for Chriſts coming to raiſe the dead, for thats paſt and gone before the Apoſtles age was paſt. The reſurrection of the juſt is over then, for that was to be at Chriſts coming, and why ſhould any preach now, and believe in Chriſt now, when there is nothing of hope now to be looked for? Are not theſe ſufficiently groſſe and wicked in their judgement, that dare take away the hope of Chriſts glorious appearance, and the being for ever with Chriſt to be by any man now expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it's ſtrange Chriſt ſhould come, the elements melt with ſervent heate, the trumpet ſound, the dead in Chriſt be raiſed, and no man hear, or ſpeak, or write of it in any age, except [<hi>in haereticorum cubiculis</hi>] as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, or as I may rather ſay, in the fancies of Hereticks, but alas! Reader, theſe men turn all theſe things into fables, perverting the whole Scripture to their corrupt ſenſe; by dead in Chriſt meaning but the ſpiritually dead in ſome fancied death; ſleeping in him, and the trumpet and ſhout, and reſurrection all Allegoricall; and ſo they thereby deny and undermine both the coming of Chriſt, the reſurrection and the judgement ſpoken of in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Tohelp thee againſt them, whereas they urge [we that are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord] as if they that then lived ſhould certainly live and abide till his coming, know that the Apoſtle writ of it as a thing that is hidden as to the day and time of it; and writes of the Church as of our body in all ages, and ſo by, we that live and remain, means but thoſe of us that ſhall be found living, that is, of the company of believers, with whom they numbred themſelves, becauſe then living; &amp; poſſibly not knowing but they might have lived to his coming. But it no more implies that the believers of that age ſhould live and remain till the coming of Chriſt, then that they who lived in <hi>Davids</hi> age, or when the <hi>Pſalms</hi> were penned lived in <hi>Moſes</hi> age many hundreds of years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and rejoyced in the Lord when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went over the ſea; becauſe it's ſaid <hi>Pſal. 66. 6.

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> See here one perverſion, the Apoſtle ſayes they looked for a Saviour from thence to come, namely from Heaven: and theſe ſay where we look for a Saviour, no doubt but had we ſaid ſo as they ſay of the Apoſtles, they would have reproached us, and ſaid, ſee theſe men have their Saviour to look for yet, (as in a letter to us, to our ſaying that the Saints ſeek their pardon and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt they retort, that we accuſe them of having their pardon to ſeek) ſo wicked are they; But of the Apoſtles looking for Chriſt from Heaven, they take no notice, Its no part of their Faith or Expectation it ſeems, they adde,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F. They did not ſay their converſation was at a diſtance far off above the Clouds where we (they ſay) look for a Saviour like our ſelves, but that he hath no blood in his body as we Imagine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ſaid their converſation was in Heaven, and Heaven is above the Clouds, and Gods Glory is in and above the Heavens, and in that Glory Chriſt is, and where Chriſt is there was their converſation; as they Exhort alſo to ſet our affections upon things above where Chriſt is alſo at the right hand of God, he ſayes not upon things within your ſelves, but upon things above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2, 3. But ye may ſee theſe men deny the God above, and ſay in effect with the falſe Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 21. God is a God at hand but not a God a far off. But as they ſaid not their converſation was above the Clouds, in thoſe very words, though they ſaid it in effect; So neither ſaid they their converſation was in themſelves and thence they lookt for a Saviour, their reproach of us [<hi>that we look for a Saviour like our ſelves (but that he hath no blood in his body as we imagine) whom they ſay they deſire not the knowledge of, and that our faith which is not grounded in Chriſts appearing in us is to be turned up by the roots</hi>] falls heavy upon themſelves, for all people may ſee their wickedneſſe therein; for, 1. They bely us in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we look for a Saviour like our ſelves; for we do not judge him like our ſelves, but hope that we who are very unlike unto Him being in vile bodies, ſhall be like him at his appearance, When he ſhall change our vile body that it might be faſhioned into the likeneſſe of his Glorious Body, which Glorious Body we think not like ours, for then need not ours to be changed that they may be faſhioned into the likeneſſe of his if they were in its likeneſſe already. 2. That his Body hath no blood in it, we ſay not, but leave it as a ſecret, what is the form and manner and glory of his Glorious and Glorified Body, we ſay that that body in which Chriſt ſhewed Fleſh and Bones after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and whoſe blood was ſhed out is aſcended and is in Heaven Glorified, and for him in that Glorious Body, we with the Apoſtles look for him from Heaven. But, 3. Here they clearly ſay they deſire not the knowledge of that Saviour we look for from Heaven, and ſo are out of the Apoſtles faith and hope, and like the wicked ones that ſaid they deſired not the knowledge of Gods wayes, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14. 4. When they ſay, <hi>that Faith which is not grounded in Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in us is to be turned up by the Roots;</hi> Do they not plainly imply that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles faith is to be turned up by the roots, (indeed we ſee how broadly they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it) for though the knowledge of Chriſt was given into the Apoſtles hearts, and his Life and Vertues appeared in their Doctrine and walking, yet their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110170:28"/>
faith was not grounded in his appearing in them, but in what Chriſt had done in his death and ſufferings for them, and in his appearing at Gods right hand for them, ſee elſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. Their faith ſtood in this that Chriſt had died, yea rather was riſen again, and is at Gods right hand making interceſſion for them; but we may ſee how far theſe mens faith differs from the Apoſtles, that make no account of Chriſts appearing in the fleſh, or in his Glorious Body hereafter; So as to have their faith grounded therein but only in an imaginary appearance of Chriſt in them, for ſo it muſt be, and no better, that hath not for the ground of it Chriſt appearing in the fleſh for them before they were born, and ſo not in them, and his appearing in Heaven for them, and in Glory to them at the end of the World; The faith of which they imply muſt be turned up by the Roots; for mind what they oppoſe that ſaying to, We ſaid that at once they turne up by the Roots all the faith of Chriſts appearing in the preſence of God to Mediate for us and make interceſſion, which the Apoſtles and Primitive believers had ſo much of their hope and rejoycing in, as alſo all the Faith and Hope of his Glorious deſcending and coming again to change our vile bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to all the Kingdome and Glory to be revealed to and enjoyed by the Saints; Now they taking no notice of Chriſts appearing in Heaven to Mediate for us, and having ſpoken of the Faith of Chriſts coming again from Heaven as a thing paſt in <hi>Pauls</hi> age, ſay that our faith which is not grounded in Chriſts appearing in us (which implyes all the points before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, for Chriſts appearing in us cannot be the ground of the faith of thoſe things but only a fruit and confirmation of it) is to be turned up by the Roots, ſo that they deny the fundamental Doctrines to eſtabliſh only their imaginary conceits. But remember Reader that they ſaid before that the Apoſtles were the true Apoſtles, and ſo they be but falſe Apoſtles and Prophets, in their imaginations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We charged them as Reprobate concerning the faith about the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead, and thou mayeſt ſee Reader what good ground we had ſo to do by what they have ſaid now about it; For if Chriſts coming, at which the dead are to be raiſed, was while the Saints in the Apoſtles time alive remained, then is the Reſurrection they ſpeak of paſt, ſo that there needs no further doubt of their corruption about that. We charged them with ſaying that the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that dies ſhall not be raiſed again, and in their Book they plead ſtifly for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F. We change</hi> George Foxes <hi>words, for he ſaid that which is raiſed is a ſpiritual body, and that that which is raiſed was dead;</hi> Well how did we repreſent them? Why thus, that that which ſhould riſe is a ſpiritual body, and that that which died is or ſhall be raiſed. It ſeemes we did not apprehend his errour fully enough, we asked about a Reſurrection to be made hereafter, and he ſubtilly anſwered about a Reſurrection paſt, for where elſe is the change, except that we ſay ſhould be raiſed; Where he ſaid that which is raiſed, we ſaid that which dyed is or ſhall be raiſed, and he ſaid (they ſay) that which is raiſed was dead, but whereas we ſaid they might mean thereby a dead ſpirit dead in ſin, they do not at all take notice of it to deny it; See then what corrupt Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we have to deal with, that when we ask about the body to be raiſed, they anſwered about ſomething raiſed that was dead, but that the body that dyeth

ſhall be raiſed they will not ſay yea, they deny it; And are they not then clearly enough Reprobate concerning the Faith of it, its probable that by the ſpirituall body that is raiſed, they mean nothing elſe but the Church, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt which was dead in ſins and treſpaſſes before quickened by him, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5. and if they ſay no, we challenge them to anſwer what that is that was dead &amp; is raiſed a Spiritual Body, if not the Church of Chriſt as being in the World in its ſeveral ages; They tell how they put the fool upon us (its I kely for believing the Reſurrection of the Body which the Apoſtles put upon the denyers of it, and ſo rather appertains to them) <hi>how they anſwered us plainly, and we would not be ſatisfied that it is ſown a natural body and is raiſed a Spiritual body.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> But yet when we asked what that [it] was that was ſown a natural body and ſhould be raiſed a Spiritual body, they would never tell us, and how then ſhould we be ſatisfied with their Anſwer.</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>The Apoſtles doth not ſay that that which dies or is ſown, which is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall riſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judge Reader, Saith not the Apoſtle it is ſown a Natural body, it is raiſed a Spiritual body, and this corruptible ſhall put on in-corruption, now is not the Naturall body an earthly body, and is not this corruptible an earthly body? Is not that an Earthly body that is laid in the grave and is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And if this corruptible put on incorruption, and this mortal (and is not that the Earthly body?) put on immortality, then doth not this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and Earthly body riſe incorruptible, and this mortal riſe immortal? Is it not as plain as the <hi>Sun?</hi> If it be this mortal that is now mortal that puts on Immortality, then its this that is now mortal that ſhall be in the Reſurrection Immortal, and if this thats now mortal ſhall put on Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, then this thats now mortal is not to be Annihilated and loſt; for how can that that is not put on any thing, much leſſe Immortality? The mortal ſhall looſe its Mortality, and put on Immortality; and the corruptible ſhall looſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and corruptibility, and put on incorruption; but the corruptible it ſelf and the mortal it ſelf ſhall not be loſt, but riſe Incorruptible and Immortal.</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>They told us that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened except it dye, and that which thou ſoweſt thou ſoweſt not that body which ſhall be (mark, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be) but bare graine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which (they ſay) is contrary to what we affirmed that the ſame body (namely) that dies or is ſowen in the Earth ſhall riſe again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Now Reader, minde again how they are clearly out, mind the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words again, and mind ours, and ſee if they be contrary, the Apoſtle ſays not that which thou ſoweſt ſhall never be quickened, but be utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened except it die; implying that if it die, it (even that thou ſoweſt) ſhall be quickened; and doth not that agree with our ſaying, that the body that dies ſhall be raiſed again, even that thou ſoweſt if it die it ſhall be quickened, but not unleſs it die; it is not one thing that dies and another that is quickened, but the ſame that being ſown dies is quickened being dead; This confirmes and is not contrary to our ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Again the Apoſtle ſaith, and that which thou ſoweſt thou ſoweſt not that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110170:29"/>
body that ſhall be, but bare grain, but then he adds (which they leave out) but God giveth it (mark <hi>it,</hi> the ſame that thou ſoweſt) a body as pleaſeth him, to every Seed his own body; the Apoſtle ſayes, that men ſow not the ſame body that ſhall be, nor ſay we that men ſow or yeeld up to death the ſame body that ſhall be, that is immortal incorruptible bodies, for ſo they ſhall be, but its this mortal body they ſow that ſhall be immortal, and this corruptible body that ſhall put on incorruption and be incorruptible, the ſame that men ſow riſeth, but they ſow it not the ſame that it ſhall riſe; the Apoſtles inſtance clears it evidently, for ſaith he, thou ſoweſt bare grain, it may chance of Wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſignifying that the body ſown, is not that it ſhall be in reſpect of form or condition; Therefore he ſaith, bare grain, as if he ſhould ſay thou ſoweſt it not in ſtalk, and blade, and ear, and kirnel in the husk, as it ſhall be, but bare grain, and in that thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be, but he ſaith, not that body thou ſoweſt ſhall not come again in another manner of body, but implies the contrary, in ſaying God giveth it (what it, if not that it thou ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? For <hi>G. W.</hi> knows that the word <hi>it</hi> is a relative, and hath reference to that that went before) a body as pleaſeth him, that is ſuch a body as to its form as pleaſeth him, to every ſeed its own body, that which is ſutable to it ſelf, and of the ſame nature which it was, though not the ſame in manner and form, and this agrees with, and is not contrary to what we further ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> it is the ſame that is ſown which is raiſed, though it riſe not the ſame (in the ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and condition) as its the ſame bare grain that is ſown, that comes up or is quickened if it die, but it comes not up the ſame bare grain, but in the body that God gives it, for the body is changed as to its quality and form, ſo its ſown a mortal body, and the ſame mortal body that is ſown ſhall riſe, but it ſhall not riſe the ſame mortal body, it ſhall riſe immortal, can any thing be more plain? We ſay the ſame body that dies or is ſown in the earth ſhall riſe, but we ſay not that its the ſame body that dies or is ſown in the earth, that it ſhall be when it riſes, And therefore ſay not any thing contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaying; We ſay not mens bodies die immortal or ſpiritual as they ſhall riſe, But we ſay the bodies that are ſown mortal and natural, ſhall riſe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Thomas Moors</hi> ſaying, that the ſame Kirnel of Wheat, riſes up again in the blade; They ſay, <hi>It is known that the ſame Kirnel doth not riſe, but another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Ear of corn grows forth in the nature of that which is ſown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we appeal to ſenſe, whether it be not that Kirnel that is ſown that is changed into the Blade, that ſprings out and grows into blade, ear, and corn, as that other body or ear of corn grows forth in the nature of that which is ſown, ſo it ſprings out of that which is ſown too, and that was ſown is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and grows into that which comes up and not another thing, that being annihilated.</p>
               <p>They talk of Riddles (but of their own imagination) of (conceited) Seeds and the nature of them, and their center and habitation, like thoſe conceits of <hi>Jacob Behmen,</hi> which are all Aliens to the Apoſtles diſcourſe, which we paſs by as things frivolous and impertinent, being nothing but carnal imaginations of men deſtitute of the Truth, and that believe not Gods Doctrine; And as for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110170:29"/>
what they ſay of the laſt Trumpet in the laſt day, and the Reſurrection of juſt and unjuſt; We ſee their corruption about it in what was ſaid by them above, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Saints in <hi>Pauls</hi> time remained till that coming of Chriſt, which is to be with a ſhout, and with the Voice of the Arch-angel and Trump of God, by which they know that though they uſe the Scripture Words of <hi>the laſt Trumpet Sounding, and Reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt, and that many that ſleep in the Duſt of the Earth ſhall riſe and ſhall come forth, ſome to the Reſurrection of Life, and ſome to the Reſurrection of Condemnation, every one to be rewarded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Works, and that</hi> John <hi>ſaid, the Sea gave up the dead in it, and Death and Hell delivered up that which were in them, and they were judged, &amp;c.</hi> Yet we know by what is already ſaid by them in their Book, and by their Queſtions to us, in which they propound; <hi>Shall the Souls of the wicked which are in Hell and have received their judgement come forth again to receive a ſecond judgement,</hi> that they are void of the faith of thoſe ſayings, and turn them into deluſions of their own or other mens inventions, for what ſhall riſe that ſleeps in the duſt (or that is in the graves, as in <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 28, 29) if not the Body that was laid into it which they ſay riſes not? And what ſhall Hell and death give up, if Hell give up no ſouls in it as their queſtion implies, and death give up no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it? For what ſhould it give up? Is it the Spirit that dies not with the body? but when the body goes to duſt it returns to God; but ſure the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayes its the Body that is now vile, that ſhall be changed, that <hi>it</hi> (mark that <hi>it</hi> and <hi>its</hi> a Relative, and relates to that before it, which there is the vile body, that it) may be faſhioned into the likeneſſe of his Glorious Body which they believe not; and therefore what but deceit and equivocation is this in their Hearts, while they quote the Words of Scripture, that ſay, <hi>every man ſhall be Judged according to his Works,</hi> if neither the Soul nor the Body come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what of the man is that that ſhall be judged? Let all judge. And this (they ſay) is an anſwer about the Reſurrection, but ſuch an anſwer as clearly denies it, and turns it up by the roots, as not grounded in their conceited ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt in them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>W. and F.

               <p>But they plead for <hi>John Whiteheads</hi> corrupt ſayings, reproaching our <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F. expecting the redemption of the body after death as contrary to the Saints expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for they waited and groaned</hi> (they ſay) <hi>for the redemption of the body from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der corruption, when they were upon earth, and the creature it ſelf was to be brought into the Glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, which ſtate was witneſſed by as many as were led by the Spirit of God who were ſanctified throughout in body, in Soul and in Spirit, and put not redemption afar off till after death, as they ſay we do.</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110170:30"/>
they bely the Saints in ſaying the expecting the redemption of the body after Death is contrary to the Saints expectation; did not the Saints expect that after death, their bodies ſhould be raiſed incorruptible? Did they look to have their bodies immortal, incorruptible, powerful and glorious before their death? read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and ſee if theſe men be not lyars in grain, and wofully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt like <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phyletus,</hi> that ſaid the reſurrection was paſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 17. 18. 2. They aequivocate in ſaying they waited and groaned for the redemption of the body from under corruption when they were upon earth, in one ſenſe it is true, and in another falſe; It is true, while they were upon earth, they exerciſed their patient waiting and expectation, but falſe that they expected that the redemption of their body ſhould be proved by them before death, the redemption of it, I ſay, either from all the being of ſin therein, or to the being of ſin in it till death, we ſpake before and proved it from, Pſ. 143. 2. for they ſay its ſown in corruption and raiſed in incorruption, if it be ſown in corruption, when it dies then it is not redeemed from corruption before it die, 3. That the Creature it ſelf is to be brought into the liberty of the Sons of God is true, but that that ſtate was witneſſed, that is proved by as many as were led by the Spirit of God is falſe, for the Apoſtle was led by the Spirit of God, and ſo are the Sons of God; but if they witneſſed the Creatures being brought into the liberty of the Sons of God and the Redemption of their bodies from corruption, how ſayes he then that the earneſt expectation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture waits for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God, ſeeing what they waited for they did not ſee and prove, and ſo could not witneſſe it, for if they ſee it, why did they yet wait for it? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. 19, 20. 23, 24, 25. Why ſay they the creature it ſelf ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is delivered from it? yea, and why ſay they expreſly, we that have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, even we our ſelves groaning within our ſelves, wait for the Adoption, the Redemption of the body, for we are ſaved by hope, &amp;c. Were not the Apoſtles led by the Spirit that had the firſt fruits of it? And <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. And were not they ſanctified throughout, in Body, Soul and Spirit, at leaſt in good meaſure? And yet we ſee they did but wait for the Redemption of the Body, they did not witneſſe it as a thing which they had, nor do we ever find them ſay they had it, but they confound the Redemption of the body, with the freeing it from ſin in it, as <hi>G. W.</hi> in his late diſpute, with <hi>J. H.</hi> declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, alleadging <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. his being ſet free from the Law of ſin and death, for proof that <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſed the Redemption of the body, when as <hi>Paul</hi> had that before he ſaid he waited for this, nor doth it prove any abſolute freedom from the being of ſin in his body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 26. ſhews;</p>
               <p>So ſee all men how corrupt the <hi>Quakers</hi> be, and how miſerable out of the Apoſtles Doctrine and Faith.</p>
               <p>And yet fourthly, We ſay not that either we or the Apoſtles put Redemption far off, till after death; It is God that hath Ordered the Redemption there ſpoken of to be after Death, that we might firſt bear the image of the Earthly in a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110170:31"/>
vile Mortal body before we bear the Image of the Heavenly in a Glorious body, it was their part and ſo is ours to groan after it and waite for it till the time of Chriſts deſcending from Heaven, to change our vile body that it may be faſhioned into the likeneſſe of his Glorious body; was ever any mans body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from Corruption and Death and Rottenneſſe before it died? They may as well contradict the Apoſtle, and ſay that which thou ſoweſt is quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before it die. All men may ſee theſe be deniers of the Reſurrection preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles, and therefore Teachers that are to be accounted accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Note by the way, Reader, that theſe men never attempt to anſwer our Queſtion propounded to them at both our former diſputes, whether that that ſhall riſe a Spiritual body was ever dead; ſurely they by their ſhunning it do declare that they do not believe it, and therefore by conſequence deny the Reſurrection of the dead.</p>

To aſſert it, is not to confeſſe but vertually to deny him as come in the Fleſh. The like we may ſay of the other phraſe, he is not the living God the Saviour of all men as he was before the World was, for he is the living God now in the Manhood or as Immanuel God with us; as made fleſh and dead and raiſed, but ſo he was not before the World was, and as not the living God in mans Nature, or Incarnate, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo to be, &amp; as ſuch conſidered or as therethrough made manifeſt, he is not ſince the fall the object of our knowledge to Salvation; and though they ſay <hi>they do not deny his knowledge as in his fleſh,</hi> that is an Equivocal deceitful ſpeech, its evident what they ſay puts no neceſſity or grants not the ſufficiency of the knowledge of him as come in the Fleſh, and ſo doth not confeſſe or magnifie it, but exalts as ſufficient that that was before and without it.</p>

They that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with their Books may ſee but canting in all this, for if we may believe what is printed as their Anſwer to the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Queries, they juſtified <hi>Richard Hubber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thorns</hi> ſaying, that Chriſts coming in the fleſh was but a figure (which ſince I writ the former expreſſions I ſee not diſowned but juſtified by <hi>G.

And did not he (namely the Scholer he anſwers) never read that Chriſt is the figure, his Fathers ſubſtance, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Which may ſerve to cheat ſilly men and women, but if Chriſts coming was but a figure, then not the true Pacifier of

Why elſe was he beaten from it and waved it upon our clearing it that it was the Apoſtles knowing him as one that dyed for all that led him to let go that knowledge of him after the fleſh there denyed by him, and therefore that knowing him as one that died, was not the knowledge after the fleſh? Nor were we declaring or ſpeaking about our knowing Chriſt one way or other, when he brought it but againſt the knowledge they plead for, as the knowledge to Salvation; falſe it is therefore that he brought it againſt our knowledge of him, which we matter not his reproaching of, who is grievouſly and notoriouſly erroneous as hath been ſeen, yea doth not his diſtinction here, in his reproaching our knowing Chriſt (as he was in the fleſh or after the Spirit) plainly imply that the knowing Chriſt as he was in the fleſh, is not with them the knowing him after the Spirit, &amp; ſo that the knowing him after the Spirit is not the knowing him as come in the fleſh, contrary to 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. by which they are diſcovered to be Antichriſtians, if they judge them the ſame, why do they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and divide them? It plainly implyes that the Spirit after which they know him, doth not teach them to know him as he was in the fleſh, yea its plain too, that by that phraſe of knowing him after the Spirit, (in <hi>E. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

ſerve him as in nothing to be guilty of the neglect of him? We ſhall, God ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, be more induſtrious to mind him &amp; manage his truth againſt theſe mens errors then we have formerly been; much leſſe is there either truth or knowledge but Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Confuſion, in their making the knowledge of Chriſt as before the World was the knowledge of the Glory of God, for the Glory of God is his great goodneſſe manifeſted, and brightly ſhining forth in Chriſt, ſent forth and crucified for us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. 6. It is the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God that is in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, as repreſented in the Goſpel, which preaches him crucified; And ſo that Glory could not be known as he was before the World was, for God was manifeſted in the fleſh, and not as before and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fleſh, or reſpect to it ſo as to our Salvation; Beſides there is fallacy in ſaying (<hi>the Spirit and Power in which the Apostles knew Chriſt, and one another was before the World was</hi>) for its one thing to ſay the Spirit and Power was before the World was, and the object now manifeſted, as now manifeſted by that Spirit and Power the knowledge whereof is to Salvation, is Chriſt as he was before the world was, and not as he was made fleſh ſince the world.</p>
               <p>Having made good theſe our charges of them, we ſhall be briefer in the reſt.</p>
               <p>P. 13. <hi>Our diſtinction of the condition of the Nature of man, as it is in the believer from what it is in Chriſt, they charge with making it in the believers to be ſeperate from Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we ſay, we believe and ſay with the Apoſtle, that the believer while in the body is abſent from Chriſt, but not ſeperate; Yet we ſay his nature as in him, is diſtinct from it as in Chriſt, becauſe in the believer its ſubject to infirmity, and bodily Death, in Chriſt it is not, they deny the ſinfulneſſe of Nature, (commonly called Original ſin) contrary to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. <hi>Job.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. 18, 19. And ſay, (<hi>that to make the believer to have two Heritages, a Natural and a Spiritual, is an old deluſion of the Prieſts</hi>) it ſeems then believers have no ſuch Heritage as bodily weakneſſe or Death, or if they have it, its a Spiritual and not a Natural Heritage to them, is it? But we believe, and ſo do all that know anything, that the believer by Nature and after the Fleſh, as a man inherits one thing, and after the Spirit as a believer another; After the fleſh and by Nature the Image of the Earthly, and after the Spirit, the Image of the Heavenly; was not <hi>Paul</hi> one of the Prieſts that here they reproach, for he taught ſuch a diſtinction in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. 46. 49. There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body, is the believer heir to both by Nature, or to neither of them Naturally? Let them anſwer directly, if they reproach that diſtinction which holds alſo in ſin and Righteouſneſſe, if the Prieſt <hi>Paul</hi> may be believed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. 25. For in his fleſh he found the law of ſin and had ſin dwelling; we ſuppoſe that was no Spiritual heritage, and in his mind the Law of God, we ſuppoſe that was not Natural, and do not theſe men imply the ſame they condemn, in ſaying the Believers witneſſe a better Heritage then ſin in their Nature? Do they not imply that they witneſſe that too, though a better beſides? However may not believers witneſſe that, and yet witneſſe alſo a better then that as <hi>Paul</hi> did? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in him, in his fleſh dwelt no good thing, whence had he that Heritage? and yet in his minde was the Law of God, was not that a better Heritage?</p>

                  <hi>How T. M.</hi> owned the Blood of Chriſt to be the foundation of faith, may be ſeen in the Anſwer to what they noted in their Epiſtle as his Principles.

               <p>To which charges I ſay, to the firſt of them; <hi>Firſt,</hi> I confeſſe my ſelf a man, and ſubject to forgetfulneſs and overſights, eſpecially when in haſt with buſineſſe, and ſo I did in my forgetfulneſſe write the word <hi>Job</hi> for <hi>Elihu,</hi> becauſe the Book doth wholly bear the Title of <hi>Job;</hi> But <hi>Secondly,</hi> what great error was in that, ſeeing <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> was an holy man as well as <hi>Job,</hi> and came not againſt <hi>Job</hi> otherwiſe then God himſelf after did to reprove him for ſome raſh expreſſions which <hi>Job</hi> alſo afterward acknowledged his evil in, and <hi>Job</hi> as much implyed his not knowing God in the ſenſe <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks of, in <hi>Job</hi> 42. 3. <hi>I have uttered,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that I underſtood not, and things too wonderful for me,</hi> and <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks as much of his knowing God as <hi>Job, Job</hi> 32. 18. <hi>I am full of matter, the ſpirit within me conſtraineth me,</hi> &amp;c. and 33. 3. 6. <hi>my words ſhall be of the uprightneſs of my heart, my lips ſhall utter knowledge clearly,</hi> which he could not have done, had he in no ſenſe or in no good ſenſe known God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nor doth God at all reprove <hi>Elihu</hi> as ſpeaking a miſſe in any thing of him, as he did <hi>Job</hi> and his other friends; So that the matter was not material, onely it ſhowed that I was forgetful, and are not theſe men ſo too? Or are they more then men? Sure they would be thought ſo, and not to be of them of whom <hi>James</hi> ſayes, my Brethren be not many maſters (that is, be not cenſorious and harſh, lording it over men, as if you were without Spot or failing) knowing we ſhall receive the greater condemnation, for in many things we offend all; the people muſt conceive that all they write and ſay is by infallible inſpiration; To this purpoſe was it that <hi>George Fox,</hi> happening to come by a letter I writ in anſwer to <hi>G. W.</hi> in vvhich (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt draught of it) upon ſome revievv, finding ſome things ſpoken to in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110170:35"/>
ſubſtance of them in two or three places as I was occaſioned by diverſe paſſages of like import, in <hi>G. Ws.</hi> Letter I had blotted out in one place 2. or 3. lines as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpoken to in another place, and inſtead thereof, write ſome other things that came to my mind that I judged meet; now <hi>G. Fox,</hi> finding this, writes in the margin of my letter this or the like queſtion; whether what I had firſt written and blotted out, I was led to write by the Spirit of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet in <hi>Geo. Ws.</hi> Letter there were many blottings out of words, as for Miniſtry of ſin which he had writ he blotted it out, and writ ſinful Miniſtry, and in one place interlined a whole line, are not theſe right <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> that will fault failings of Memory and ſuch corrections of miſtakes as paſſe in us, and therein glory and pretend to others as if all they writ and ſpake was by the Spirit, and yet wherein they glory they are found even as we, as is ſaid by <hi>Paul</hi> of the falſe Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11. As for God ſpeaking againſt <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> as not ſpeaking of him the thing that was right as <hi>Job</hi> did, it was after <hi>Job</hi> had humbled himſelf, and confeſt his fault, and God had forgiven him, for before God faulted him alſo as not ſpeaking rightly of him; See elſe <hi>Job</hi> 38. 1. 2. and 40. 2. Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty inſtruct him, he that reproveth God let him anſwer it, ſure he that reproveth God doth not ſpeak right of him; So <hi>ver.</hi> 8. wilt thou diſannual my judgement, and condemn me that thou mighteſt be righteous? But again, doth it follow that becauſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake not rightly of God in ſome things, therefore he ſpeak not right of the Angels, or nothing at all right of God? Is not this a right thing that he ſaid of God, that he doth great things and unſearchable marvilous things, and without number, and that he gives rain upon the Earth, <hi>&amp;c. Job.</hi> 5. 8. 9. Beſide that what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaid of the Angels as charged with folly is related by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> rather as a thing revealed to him, and ſaid to him in a viſion by a Spirit, then as any ſaying of his own, ſee elſe <hi>Job</hi> 4. 13. 14. 15 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>But would ye know why <hi>G. W.</hi> made this exception againſt my quoting of <hi>Eliphas</hi> his words, it was becauſe I ſaid it was the good Angels way to abaſe themſelves in Gods preſence, and not to proclaim themſelves holy but God, as not judging themſelves pure in compariſon of him, whereas the evil Angels uſe to proclaime themſelves as Gods, and deſire to be worſhipped; and becauſe I compared the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> practice to that of the evil Angels and not of the good, therefore <hi>George</hi> would put that off by ſaying thoſe were <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his words that ſpake not aright of God, but I mentioned alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 2. 3. 4. which he fairly paſt over with ſilence, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his exception againſt that in <hi>Job.</hi> 4. and 15. was enough to blind his ſeduced Diſciples eyes that they would never minde what <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid; <hi>as for my belying the Servants of the Lord (as he falſely calls the</hi> Quakers) <hi>in my Book, and falſe Letters ſent abroad into the Country as he charges me;</hi> thou mayeſt judge of the truth of that (<hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) by the truth or falſhood of theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> in all hitherto diſcovered, its no diſcredit to be called a lyar and deceiver, by lyars and deceivers, they ſay [<hi>I have often belyed them and they could produce them</hi>] tis well they do not produce them though, but onely ſay what they can do, thinking you will call them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters therein and take it for a truth upon their bare ſay ſo; But can you think their charity ſuch to me, as to have mentioned no one thing I have belyed them in, if they had many to produce? What they ſay about our probable Arguments on both ſides, about the reuniting of the blood of Chriſt, with the body in his Reſurrection

needs no anſwering; The impartial Reader of our Book may obſerve, that there is onely mentioned what might be alleadged on either part of the queſtion, without any determinations; and ſo that they ſay falſly, that <hi>we gueſſed it either way, that a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy could have given as good an anſwer as we gave above,</hi> (againſt which they are able here to except nothing, ſave to diſſemble it that we gave not that anſwer then) is not very credible; but if ſo, it ſeems theſe Prophets could have given no better neither, for they fault us not, they ſay, for not aſſerting it in the Body of Chriſt; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings and reproaches we paſs over in ſilence, onely whereas amongſt thoſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, we ſaid about that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. So (Fleſh and Blood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God) that in the changed ſtate, what was blood before might be changed into Pure Life and Spirit, the thing or ſubſtance remaining, though not in the ſame form of Blood, which yet we conclude not, but leſt to the judgement of the able in the Church.</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>This is a meer dreame, and one of</hi> J. Hs. <hi>divinations, and contradicts</hi> Moors <hi>words, for he ſaid, that the Life of Christ is not in his blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We <hi>Reply,</hi> That it is a dream or divination of <hi>J.

               <p>To their Queſtion, <hi>What is the Body of fleſh and bones turned into then?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We Anſwer, His Body had fleſh and Bones in it, in the raiſed changed ſtate as he ſhewed his Diſciples; And therefore that they are changed into any other thing, or that the bodies of the Saints raiſed ſhall not have Fleſh and Bones in them as his had, follows not.</p>
               <p>What they ſay in the remainder of <hi>page</hi> 17. is all ſpoken to before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> Whereas <hi>p.</hi> 18. they ſay, <hi>That they believe not that when Chriſt after the Reſurrection ſhewed his Diſciples his Hands and his Feet, his Body then had no blood in it.</hi>

               <p>We will not contend with them about it, for neither is it an Article of our Faith, though their conceit proves not that it had, nor can it be any thing more then a meer gueſſe, though they are ſo infallibly led, they pretend that they muſt not be thought by their Diſciples to gueſſe at any thing, as if they knew it not.</p>

                  </hi> This is true of mortal fleſh in its natural ſtate, but that Chriſt eat becauſe he needed ſuch nouriſhment after his Reſurrection for his raiſed body we believe not, but to demonſtrate by infallible proofs, that he was truly raiſed in a real and not a

fantaſtical body; And therefore all this is to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As for what they prate of <hi>The Body of Christ in Glory, and the Bodies of the Saints in the Reſurrestion, that they ſhall as far exceed in Glory, theſe our earthly bodies, as the Sun, Moon and Stars do exceed the bodies of birds, beasts and Fiſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are but Viſors to hide their uglineſſe, for what reſurrection is there of the Saints, if that body that dyed ſhall never riſe? Can any thing be ſaid to riſe again that never fell or dyed? as they ſay, <hi>The body that dies ſhall not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But therefore they tell us, <hi>The mystery of theſe things is for ever ſealed up in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from ſuch blind guides as they reproach us to be who have long abuſed the Truth; &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems Reader, they would have thee know that whatever they ſeem to ſay fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have another meaning couched under it, and ſo they walk in hidden things of diſhoneſty, and deal deceitfully, and would make us believe the Apoſtles did ſo too, who commended themſelves to every mans Conſcience in the ſight of God, and did not hide their meanings, but ſpeak openly what Chriſt ſpake to them in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but theſe have uſually another meaning for the Apoſtles ſayings, becauſe they believe them not in their own meaning in which they uttered them; underſtand Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that (as <hi>Joſeph Fiſher</hi> a Quaker in a Paper to us implies) the change of the Body is made by the Babe within here, before the ſeparation of the Soul and Body, and ſo that their ſpiritual bodies are thoſe that excel ſo in glory above the Bodies of Beaſts and Birds, that is, thoſe that are not in and of the ſame corrupt mind with them; Some ſuch myſtery they put upon the Apoſtles plaineſt ſayings to make them Parables.</p>
               <p>To juſtifie their corrupt Doctrine, <hi>that the Scriptures are not the Medium of Faith</hi> (which we diſproved from <hi>John 17. 20. Acts</hi> 17. 11, 12.)</p>
               <p>They alledge, <hi>That no Scripture ſayes the Scriptures are the Medium of Faith.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Nor ſay they Chriſt is the Medium neither, though the word Medium be not expreſſed, the ſence of it is, as (through their words.)</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>The Apostles were not Miniſters of Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> If by Letter they mean the writing of words as in Epiſtles and Letters, its falſe, for they Miniſtred the Knowledge of God, both by Vocal Preaching, and by writing it in Epiſtles and Letters, ſo as men in reading their writings might ſee the Truth and acknowledge it, and underſtand their Knowledge in the Myſtery of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 13. Epheſ.</hi> 3. 4. 5. and though their words however Miniſtred by them, whether by audible voice or writing, our Saviour ſuppoſes men ſhould believe, for he limits it not to any one way of Miniſtration; Are not the ſayings of the Apoſtles their words becauſe they be written? The Letter of which the Apoſtles ſayes they were not Miniſters, is clearly the Law oppoſed to the Goſpel, which is a Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit, whether ſpoken or written. Now (through their words) is all one in ſence, as to ſay their words are a Medium of mens believing.</p>
               <p>To that of the <hi>Bereans</hi> they ſay, That <hi>the</hi> Bereans <hi>firſt received the Word with all readineſſe of mind, and then ſearched the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this they ſay of their own head, for the Scriptures ſay not ſo, but that they <hi>received the word with all readineſse of mind, and ſearched the Scripture, and that therefore many of them believed,</hi> which implies their ſearching the Scriptures and finding them to agree with the Apoſtles words was a Medium or mean of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier believing; But of thoſe words urged by us, they take no notice, they could

once and again make ſomething of <hi>there,</hi> when it ſignified nothing but hereof, but hereof <hi>therefore,</hi> when it ſignifies or points to a mediate cauſe they make nothing. Oh perverſe and crooked generation! nor doth the mentioning their ſearching the Scriptures after the mention of their receiving the word imply that they firſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word, and then ſearched the Scriptures, no more then the mentioning of mens confeſſing with the mouth the Lord Jeſus before the believing him in the heart, raiſed from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. implies that the confeſſion muſt be firſt in being before believing in the ſame perſon. Nor doth the Greek mention any (<hi>and</hi>) but reads it thus, theſe received the word with all readineſſe, ſearching the Scriptures, and that manner of phraſe uſually ſignifies the latter as a means to the former, as may be ſeen, <hi>Acts 8. 3. 6. 9. 13. Heb. 12. 1, 2. &amp;c.</hi> their confounding the Author with the Medium is a piece of their confuſion, though Chriſt be the Author of Faith, and bring to believe, that hinders not, but the Scriptures and the Doctrine therein declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be and is the Medium; but theſe are truly Blind guides that are deſtitute of underſtanding; wo to the people that are led by them.</p>

One while it is the ſeed which is Chriſt that is burthened in man by corruption, that is to be redeemed, and another while its the believer in the Light for the Redemption, ſo that both Chriſt and the believer are to be Redeemed; But who muſt redeem the Seed which is Chriſt? Thats but darkly and confuſedly hinted, <hi>Babel</hi> like, The power ſure that reaches to the ſeed, but what is that? Is it Chriſt? Then Chriſt redeems Chriſt, is it the Spirit? Then the Spirit redeems Chriſt where he is begotten; So that here is Chriſt begotten, and Chriſt ſuffering, and burthened with ſin to be redeemed by the Power or Spirit, and all in them that believe in the light for Redemption, but what is that light they believe in? Sure that muſt be Chriſt too, unleſſe it be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him leſſe then Chriſt; but how ſhould a Believer believe in a Chriſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that wants it himſelfe, and is the ſubject of it?

The Apoſtles preacht Chriſt dead and raiſed for all, never that he is yet dying and riſing for and in ſome. But,</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>The Apoſtle travelled again for the Galathians till Chriſt was formed in them, who firſt is known as one without form or comlineſse.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> That the Apoſtle traviled again in birth of the <hi>Galathians</hi> till Chriſt was formed in them, is true; But even as the <hi>Galathians</hi> were not perſonally and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in <hi>Paul,</hi> though he traveled again in birth of them, but onely in his love and affection: So neither are we ſo carnally and fantaſtically to conceive of Chriſts forming in them, as if he was a ſeed or principle to be begotten and redeemed in them, and ſuffering, and burthened in them, and to be brought forth into form in them perſonally, but onely the knowledge and faith of him was to be brought forth or formed in their hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is it true but very falſe, that Chriſt is firſt known as one without form or comlineſſe, but rather while he is ſo apprehended he is not known, its mens ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, unbelief, and wrong thoughts of him makes them ſee no beauty in him; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in their perſon as one of that body, and prophecying of the mean appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh, ſignifies how he ſhould through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and unbelief be rejected by them, and they ſhould ſee no form or comelineſſe in him, wherefore they ſhould deſire him as the verſes following alſo ſhew, not that any knowing him, firſt know him ſo.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Here is their ſence of Chriſts death and Reſurrection, Chriſts dying and riſing in men, and this is the word that they ſay is in every man before outward Preaching; The word of Faith nigh in the heart and in the mouth, but what need Preachers be ſent then to preach this, or who be the Preachers ſent of God in men to declare it, without whoſe being ſent of God they could not Preach it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe preaching men could not hear and believe! Yea in this Myſterious and <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> ſtuffe, here is Chriſt forming, ſuffering and riſing at once; Suffering in ſome and riſing in others, and ſo the Apoſtles doctrine is turned up by the roots, as not grounded in Chriſts appearing in men; Where he ſays, Nor yet that he (Chriſt) ſhould offer himſelf often as the High Prieſt entereth into the holy Place every year with blood of others, for then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the World; but now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26.

               <p>They ſay, <hi>This is no Myſtery of deceit as we ſay of it, but a Myſtery that hath diſcovered our deceits, who know not the ſeed of the Kingdom nor the power wherein it riſes.</hi>

Wo, wo to this people and their followers, for however they are entered in for this condemnation or contention, their damnation ſlumbereth not; Flee from their tents and Teachings, their deceits and underhand denyals of the only Lord God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that bought them all, yea that would eſcape utter ruine and deſtruction, for here we have the Spirit that confeſſeth not Chriſt come in the fleſh, but making him the figure of a Spirituall wickedneſſe, or Myſterious deceit that works in them that periſh; For even in that clauſe laſt mentioned by them too, the ſeed of the Kingdom is made all one with the Son of man that ſows it, for both are Chriſt with them; but they ask, <hi>Have we never known what Chriſt is without the Camp?</hi> Surely we know he is a reproach and ſcorn to ſuch as theſe are that are not of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thither muſt we follow him bearing his reproach for owning and acknowledging his ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>But they ſay, <hi>That before we who are neglecters of Chriſt and abuſers of his Truth can know the ſeed of God, and what it is in us, we muſt come to the Light which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for our deceits and lyes wherewith we have abuſed the Truth, and then learn to know what and where the grave is which Chriſt hath made with the wicked.</hi>

               <p>Toward the end of our diſcourſe, turning our ſpeech to the people, we deſired them to take heed of theſe men as a heavie judgement of God that he hath ordered to us, (joyning ourſelves therein with the people as part of the National Body, as the Apoſtles and Prophets uſe to do) to puniſh us for our neglect of Chriſt the Salvation of God, and abuſe of his Truth; And here they think they have gotten a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and their mouths are exceedingly open upon us, wreſting our words and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with reproaches, twitting us over and over that we are neglecters of Chriſt, and abuſers of Gods Truth by our own confeſſion, bleſſed be God that we are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to ſuffer reproach for his Names ſake, for thats the thing they are mad at

Reader judge indifferently between us if they in thus reproaching us for joyning our ſelves with the people, and confeſſing our ſelves faulty in that we have too much neglected Chriſt, and abuſed his Truth, not ſo contended for Chriſt againſt theſe deceivers and falſe prophets as we ſhould, nor ſo uſed and walked in his Truth as we ought, and are not like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves perfect and to have no ſins to own and confeſſe?

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Alas, the beam of error in the main fundamental Doctrines of Chriſt is in their eyes, and how can they ſee moats in mine? They that erre in the foundation have no right judgement in any thing, but put light for darkneſs and darkneſs for light, though I do accept and take with thankfulneſs what God by his providence hath provided for my maintenance without my fore-ſeeing, and though that be Tithes or rather ſomething in liew of Tithes, and plead for the lawfulneſs of them as neither repugnant to Gods Law nor mans, yet doth it not thence follow that I am guilty of what the Prophets changes them with; the Prieſts alſo had their ſeveral Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs and Quarters, whence God allowed them to take their proviſion; But that the Prophets therefore faulted them, or that they fell under that reproof is not to be thought, for Gods Prophets never faulted people for doing that which God allowed them, but for their looking for other unlawful gains, or for ſetting their hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their gains or profits, and not upon or more then upon their ſervice, which that I do is more then theſe can tell, they and I muſt be judged by a more equal Judge. But I pray what Law of God or men makes it unlawful for the Nations that receive the Name of Chriſt to give the Tithes or Tenth for the maintenance of thoſe that Preach the Goſpel, or thoſe that Preach it to take them if given by them? Seeing the Rulers are to ſerve the Lord, and both Rulers and People not to muzzel the mouth of the Ox that treads out the Corn; When they can prove that is not lawful for the Nations that receive the Scriptures and Goſpel Doctrine, to give that honour and maintenance which the Scriptures require, by allotting the tenths, if
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:110170:42"/>
they pleaſe, both before and under the Law given, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18. or that in caſe they do and may do ſo, yet its not lawful for thoſe that Preach the Goſpel to receive them, then I ſhall leave off to plead for Tithes; in the mean time I ſhall bear their reproach as a piece of perſecution from them, ſuch as their power and malice can reach to, I doubt not but that they would deprive us of ſuch maintenance too if they could.</p>
               <p>Again whereas they ſay, <hi>People may ſee how they have given their money to uphold a company of ignorant blind watchmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, This reproach they may caſt upon the Lord himſelf at the rate they write at, for by their inference, when God gave the Tythes and offerings to the Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> by a Law for ever, he gave them to uphold a company of blind watchmen, and ignorant profane perſons, becauſe many of them proved ſuch, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 2. 3. and yet even when ſuch, the Lord faults the people for not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and giving them that which he by his Law made theirs, and charged them with robbing him therein, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3 8, 9, 10. but even as their God could not be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged with giving them the tenths, to uphold blind and evil perſons, becauſe he gave them them to another end, though to that end they abuſed them by not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as they ſhould have been; Even ſo now what was given by former Kings, People, and Parliaments, was given to better ends then to uphold blind ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and profane watchmen, though too many that receive it prove ſuch, and yet as then though the Prieſts proved bad and evil, the people were thieves in detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tythes; So are they now in detaining from the Miniſters what the Law of the Nations in ſubordination to the Law of God hath made theirs for better ends then to what they uſe them. As for their reproaches we leave them to God to clear our innocency; <hi>That our principles are corrupt (as they ſlander us) and that they are made maniſeſt to be ſo in their book</hi> is falſe, and I hope the Reader hereof is without all peradventure ſatisfied therein, and that the falſe and wicked principles are with themſelves, as we have clearly diſcovered; To their ſelf-commendations for their Preaching ſo freely, enough is ſaid above, the falſe Apoſtles were never the better for their preaching freely but the worſe, as the Devil is moſt pernicious when moſt Angel-like.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Herein the minding of the words will diſcover their ignorance and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, for it is ſaid, <hi>I took my ſtaffe beauty and cut it aſunder, that I might break my Covenant which I had made with all the people,</hi> (did <hi>Judas</hi> ever make a Covenant with all the people which he break?) And it was broken that day, and ſo the poor of the people that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord, (<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>did the poor of the people waite upon <hi>Judas,</hi> and therein know the word of the Lord?) <hi>And I ſaid unto them, if ye think good give me my price, and if not, forbear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So theyweighed for my price thirty pieces of ſilver, a goodly price that I was prized at of them,</hi> Mark, Was <hi>Judas</hi> prized at thirty pieces of ſilver, or did he leave his price to the High Prieſts till he had done his work, and demand it ſo indifferently then? Is it not plaine that the Prophets ſpeaks of a price of one as a ſhepherd undertaking to feed the flock of the ſlaughter (&amp; not as a Traytor to the ſhepherd) and taking to him
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110170:43"/>
two ſtaves of a ſhepherd, one called beauty and the other bands, and ſo feeding the flock, and then demanding his price when he had ſo done, nor doth <hi>Mat</hi> 27. ſay the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpake of <hi>Judas</hi> demanding his price, but what is ſaid he ſayes was by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and though the ſum of the price (Chriſt was prized at, not <hi>Judas</hi>) agree, yet the reſt of the expreſſions agree not, the one ſaith caſt it to the Potter, and the other they gave it for the potters field; Chriſt is clearly in the Prophet, the ſhepherd feeding the flock, and asking the price and not <hi>Judas,</hi> as ye have falſly ſuppoſed; but you to cover your deceit, read only ſo far, then was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that which was ſpoken by the Prophet, and there ſtop, knowing in <hi>Matthew</hi> it is <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and not <hi>Zechariah; Judas</hi> his ſaying was what will ye give me and I will deliver him to you, and the Prophets ſaying is give me my price, and a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly price that I was valued at by them, it was Chriſt that was valued ſure, and not <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> the price had been good enough for <hi>Judas</hi> to be valued at; But Chriſt ought to have had a better reward from them, and to have been far otherwiſe valued, even to have been honoured and believed in by them, and ſerved with all they were and had; he that ſays in the Prophet give me my price, is the ſame that ſays, he was valued at a goodly price, which agrees not to <hi>Judas.</hi> For taking Tythes of all people in the Pariſh bounds, we have ſaid enough above, the Nations are to give maintenance to the labourers amongſt them, the Nations giving it in this or that manner in ſuch or ſuch bounds, there the labourers may lawfully take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the hirelings and devouring beaſts are in one Nature,</hi> is ſaid by them not proved, the hireling is ſet by him that hires him to keep the ſheep, men do not uſe to hire the Wolves and Foxes to do it, though yet as we noted the hireling is not diſcribed by our Saviour to be one that takes hire (for the labourer is worthy of his hire, and may take it, yea Chriſt hires all his ſervants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 1. 15.) But he that when he ſees the beaſts come, leaves the flock to them to be devoured, which they that are hired ought not to do, though ſuch as are all for their hire, or prefer that before the flock (as too many do) will do ſo, but they have found us hitherto (bleſſed be the Lord) reſiſting the Wolves, and ſtopping their mouths, though with the hazzard of our lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſheep are ever bid to leave the hirelings if with ſuch,</hi> they ſay by their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Authority, but bring no proof for it, that they will hear Chriſts voice proves not that they ſhould not hear thoſe that are hired by him, for they that bring another voice are the Wolves not the hirelings that are diſtinguiſhed from them; Did not <hi>Judas</hi> (who proved covetous and a thief, and who they ſaid above was an hireling) when ſent forth to preach the Goſpel, carry Chriſts voice or Goſpel with him: Though his end in preaching it was not ſincere, yet the people were never faulted for hearing him, but wo denounced to them that heard not Chriſts Doctrine by any of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 4, 5. 14, 15. And <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced that Chriſt was preached, though by ſuch, <hi>Philip</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18 Therefore that proves not that the hireling is to be fled from, but the Wolfe that comes to devour from Chriſts voice, &amp; brings a ſtrange voice, as theſe men moſt manifeſtly do. Beſides, they are out againe, (as in nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt are they right) in ſaying, <hi>Such as Chriſt ſends to feed his ſheep in the paſtours of Iſrael, are no hirelings,</hi> for in ſome ſence he ſends none but ſuch, if by hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they mean one that is hired by him, or receives his hire, his labourers are all hired into his Vineyards, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. he is no ſuch maſter as to ſend any to keep his flock for nothing, yea in the worſt notion of an hireling, ſuch as he hires and ſends
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110170:43"/>
to keep his flock, may and ſometimes do prove hirelings, as <hi>Judas</hi> by their own ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was ſuch a one, and yet he was of Chriſts ſending.</p>
               <p>W. &amp; F. <hi>That the law for tithes with us in</hi> Eng. <hi>is corrupt and unjuſt, and made by Apoſtates</hi> is raſhly and haſtily ſpoken and without proof as all things elſe they ſay, and being ſaid by them who are Apoſtates from the faith indeed (as what we have ſeen of them above ſufficiently diſcovers) is the leſs to be regarded, as alſo their proud boaſtings of themſelves as Servants of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when as the Lord that bought them they have denyed, and openly ſaid they deſire not to know him whom we expect from heaven to ſave us.</p>
               <p>W. <hi>and</hi> F. <hi>They charge the faultineſſe and evils in the people reproved by us as eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our being falſe prophets, that have not profited the people, nor ſtood in Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; for had we</hi> (ſay they of us) <hi>we ſhould have turned the people that receive our Doctrine from the evil of their way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we ſay, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That moſt of the people we ſo reproved are ſuch as receive not our Doctrine, and ſo their faults are no evidences that we are like the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That many that did receive Chriſts Doctrine and his Apoſtles, were ſuch as we fault, and guilty of ſuch evils, for ſome received it as the way ſide, ſome as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſtones, ſome as amongſt thorns, and ſo ſome that received the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine received but the form of it, not the power, received the Grace of God in vain, and theſe ran into ſuch evils as we faulted, as pride, covetouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea and ſuch had <hi>Ezekiel</hi> though a true Prophet as heard him, and he was to them as one that could play well on an Inſtrument, and ſhewed much love, yet their hearts went after their covetouſneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 32. will they ſay their hearers faults ſo often faulted by them were evidences that they were falſe prophets, and ſo condemn Chriſt and his Apoſtles as falſe Prophets that ſtood not in Gods Counſel? what ſtrange inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make they, and how raſh are they in their cenſures not to ſpare Chriſt or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles at the rate they argue at.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſay, ſuch as receive our Word and Doctrine heartily, are ſuch as heartily received the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, fearers of God and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Righteouſneſs, though they have their imfirmities as they alſo had, and are confeſſors of their treſpaſſes as they alſo were, approved of God though railed at by thoſe who endeavour to pervert them, becauſe they will not be perverted by them; as for our wearing Cuffs and Ribbonds, and white boot-hoſe-tops (which we wear not) &amp;c. Therein they ſhew themſelves right <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that ſtrain at a Gnat and ſwallow Camells, deny the Reſurrection of the Body, and ſay the coming of Chriſt (that in which the dead in Chriſt are to be raiſed) is long ſince paſt, and make a ſtir about trifles and lawful Ornaments, concerning which Chriſt hath not put us in bondage or forbid them to us. We know that all (ſuch) things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though all things not expedient, but where expedient we may wear any of them with ſobriety, that leads between both extreams of others pride in them, and theſe mens ſuperſtitious condemning them as unlawful. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not faulted of God for wearing Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els<note place="margin">

women had better wear ſuch things ſoberly, as theſe men Phariſaically condemn, then make an Idol, or falſe Chriſt, or righteouſneſs to themſelves of their caſting them off as they led them to do, as the falſe Apoſtles led their Diſciples to do with their obſervations of times and dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhat they ſay of <hi>J. H.</hi> he leaves to the Lord to judge the truth of; and as for <hi>condemning our ſelves in what we judge others,</hi> we ſay, we deſire to judge our ſelves and them too in what we are guilty, but not in what they fooliſhly fault us, like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſuperſtitiouſly faulting Chriſts Diſciples for things he faulted them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Deceivers and Subverters of Souls ſpake things that the peoples Conſciences became in bondage to, and many things that through the effect of the Law in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, they could not deny but cloſe with, is falſly denyed by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For how elſe were they transformed into Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, if they ſpeak nothing ſuteable to the Letter of the Law of Righteouſneſs, ſo as that the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of people bearing witneſs to the truth of ſome of their ſayings might be brought to liſten to them and receive alſo their deluſions?</p>
               <p>They ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The Law in men is Light, and it is the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus that freeth men from the power of ſin and death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVherein ſtill they play the juglers; for <hi>Firſt,</hi> neither doth the Apoſtles ſay the Law is in every man, or in all the Gentiles, but he ſayes, <hi>the effect or work of the Law, Rom.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jeſus had made him free from the Law of ſin and death, not onely from the power of ſin and death, but from the law that convinces of ſin, and holds in bondage for it, and ſentences to death,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and 4. 4. clearly ſhew, even from under that Law that is in it ſelf holy, and juſt, and good, yet by reaſon of the fleſh could not juſtifie or ſave; Now theſe to hide their deceit, ſeeing that had they cited the Apoſtles words, they inſinuate that ſomething reproves of ſin that is not Chriſt (as we ſaid) they ſubtilly change his phraſe and turn it into another thing. How they ſet themſelves maſters in mens Conſciences, for all their feigned humility in denying that title we have before ſhewed often in this Treatiſe, and therefore here ſhall wave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. and F.</hi> They ſay, <hi>They ſuffer much for righteouſneſſe ſake, and for bearing Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against unrighteouſnes, and we oft cauſe it, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who do they here commend? themſelves and the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> for we ſaid to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a party (as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> do) they expoſe themſelves to ſome ſufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they deny not (for they know its true) that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> do ſo too, and think we they do not ſay its for Righteouſneſſe ſake, and for witneſſing againſt unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and that they may thank the Teachers often for it? Tis likely the Quakers and they are either the ſame, or of very great affinity, yet both their ends ſhall be according to their works as well as other falſe Apoſtles and falſe Prophets, who have expoſed themſelves too to great ſufferings, partly of voluntary devotion and will-worſhip, and partly from people againſt their wills, for their falſhood, as <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts and Prophets did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 28. 40. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Colloſſians</hi> 2. 20. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. and F. That we have not God nor abide in the Doctrine of Chriſt, they endeavour to prove againſt us, becauſe we ſay we</hi> (of this Nation joyning our ſelves with them, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110170:44"/>
not without guilt) have neglected Chriſt and long abuſed the Truth.</p>
               <p>But we deny their inference, for every neglect of Chriſt and abuſe of his truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives not of God, nor is accompanied with ſuch tranſgreſſion, as not to abide in his Doctrine (for who then ſhould ſtand? as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 3.) the Apoſtles had fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God and Chriſt, when yet they had ſins to confeſs, and ſo neglects of Chriſt and abuſes of truth to be cleanſed from; for in every ſin is ſome neglect of Chriſt ſure and abuſe of Truth in ſome degree or other, and ſuch things <hi>David, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Iſaiah</hi> and others confeſſed in effect, and yet in ſo doing, that is confeſſing their ſins kept in with God, receiving daily forgiveneſs of them, and cleanſing from them, and though they had ſome failings in the way yet they abide in it, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt not ſo as to leave the way. It is the Deceivers and deceived Generation, who leave the Doctrine of Chriſt for ſome corrupt myſterie and falſe imagination, that are guilty of ſuch tranſgreſſions, and abide not in the truth, nor have either Father or Son; whatever their falſe boaſtings be or ſelfe juſtifications, they are fallen from Chriſt and be accurſed. And <hi>G. W.</hi> knows that the Quakers were proved to be ſuch in our late diſpute with him to that purpoſe. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> that pleaded no ſinner was out of the Doctrine of Chriſt, when the <hi>Publican</hi> that durſt not look up becauſe of his ſins was nearer in it, they that ſay they have no ſin deceive themſelves, &amp; the truth is not in them, and ſo they have not God and Chriſt, when they that confeſſe their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects of Chriſt, and abuſes of his truth ſhall find him faithful to forgive their ſins and to cleanſe them from all unrighteouſneſſe, they are in Gods Doctrine and way to life when the others are far wide of it, for he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, he that acknowledgeth his ſin ſhall find Mercy, when he that hides and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles it, and lifts up himſelf as if innocent, is out of God and Chriſt, and ſhall be abaſed and confounded.</p>
               <p>The reſt being frothy and diſdainful reproaches, we leave them to the judgement of the Lord, and ſhall look to him to plead our cauſe againſt them (which alſo bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his holy Name, he hath in ſome meaſure done ſince the firſt draught hereof, in our latter conflict with <hi>G. W.</hi> to his no ſmall confuſion) and to keep people from their ſtrong deluſions and ſpecious but moſt pernicious deceits, having we truſt ſo laid open their nakedneſſe, that all that will may ſee their folly manifeſt, and avoid them and all their Serpent-like windings and inſinuations. Nor fear we to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them in Print, for ought that they threaten us with or can do againſt us, for the more they Print, the more ſhall their folly be made manifeſt, as the Spirit of God hath before ſignified, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9. In the ſtrength of God therefore and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall ſtand againſt them and all their aſſaults that their printing can make againſt us, bleſſing him that he hath coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us worthy (who in our ſelves are moſt unworthy) to be made his inſtruments to draw out their deceits into light, that people might be warned of them and ſo avoid them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That they begin their queſtions with a falſhood, for we are not called <hi>Moori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or <hi>Manifeſtarians</hi> that we know of, nor are ſo; for we call no man our Father or Maſter after that forbidden manner, nor own we any ſuch callings as they do that own themſelves <hi>Calvinists, Lutherans, &amp;c.</hi> nor are we Authors of what they ſay we hold forth in either the firſt or ſecond branch of it; The firſt is, <hi>Pauls</hi> fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; And as to the ſecond, that fleſh and bones may; We ſay not that fleſh and bones as natural in natural bodies may; we ſay that that Body of Chriſt which had Fleſh and Bones, after the Reſurrection of it, is taken up into heaven, and is in heaven, and the Scripture is clear for it, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 39, 40. 51, 52. what change or tranſmutation further it had in its aſcenſion and Glory we know not, but we believe that as the Apoſtles ſee him taken up into Heaven (and they ſee him taken up in that Body in which was Fleſh and Bones) ſo he ſhall come again in like manner, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11. their reproaching us for that faith ſhall not drive us from it, becauſe they are none of the True Apoſtles and Prophets, nor if they were might we give credit to them, bringing a contrary Doctrine to what we have from the Holy Apoſtles received, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. THey ask <hi>if</hi> Eliahs <hi>fleſh and bones could enter into Gods Kingdom, when he was taken up, and if his blood could not; Then when, where and how, and by whom was his blood taken and ſeparated from his fleſh and bones, and what is become of it?</hi>

               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>And what is it that hinders the blood that it cannot enter the Kingdom as well as the fleſh and bones, which ye ſay may; is the tranſgreſſion of the blood greater then the tranſgreſſion of the fleſh and bones?

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe are prophane Scoffs and Reproaches againſt Gods Truths, that the body which is ſown a natural body, ſhall be raiſed a ſpiritual body after the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Chriſt, who is the firſt fruits of them that ſleep we believe, and that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt raiſed had Fleſh and bones in it we read and believe alſo, and that fleſh and blood ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God we believe too, but prophane and vain bablings we are to ſhun, which will increaſe to more ungodlineſſe, and eat like a Canker, eſpecially the Word and Doctrine of ſuch as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> who erred concerning the Truth, and ſaid, the Reſurrection is paſt or made already, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110170:45"/>
thats theſe mens error as above ſhewed, when they ſaid, <hi>The coming of Chriſt ſpoken of</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 15, 16. (in which the dead are to be raiſed) <hi>was while the Apoſtles &amp; believers lived and remained.</hi> Therefore theſe words and prophane bablings of theirs, we and all people are to avoid, being wiſe to ſobriety, knowing that God hath no cauſe higher then himſelf, and his own good pleaſure in what he doth, and that he gives not an account of all his matters, and what he keeps ſecret is not for us to ſearch.</p>

The Scriptures ſay, Chriſt ſhall ſo come even in like manner as his Diſciples ſee him go up, and he was taken up in that Body, in which was fleſh and bones as before, which Body is now his Glorious Body; further we affirm not or inquire not.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>And whereas you</hi> John Horn <hi>and</hi> Thomas Moor <hi>in page</hi> 16. ſay, <hi>That Sathan doubtleſſe may reprove of ſome ſins, and preſſe to ſome duties; now have you not herein ſhewed your ſelves to be miniſters of Sathan and not of Chriſt, &amp;c?</hi>

               <head>An Anſwer to the Queſtions forementioned.</head>
               <p>THeſe Queſtions give ſo full intimation of their Antichriſtian Spirit, and give us ſuch occaſion to diſcover it to others, and ſo evidence the Truth of God in the great things of his Doctrine againſt their endeavours to make it void, That ſince all the three forementioned have owned them, as ſent by them all, We have judged it ſeaſonable, and tending to the profit of many that they may be ſaved, to make them with this anſwer publick, which anſwer is owned by <hi>John Horn,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> ſenior, and <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> junior.</p>
               <p>And in it we deſire the Readers to note, that we direct not our ſpeech to them, becauſe they have been already diſcovered, and proved deceivers, and Antichriſts, and as ſuch rejected by us; But in this we apply our ſelves to the Reader in general, intending herein a farther diſcovery of that myſterie of iniquity and ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and Antichriſt, that works privily in and by them, to a denying the Lord that bought them, and that by a manifeſtation of the Truth, without hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſſe as they have done; That ſo we may be inſtrumental in inſtructing the Ignorant, ſtrengthening the weak, and edifying and preſerving believers in their moſt holy Faith; And if yet it might be to any of them in undeceiving the deceived, that are already turned aſide after Satan, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the pernicious wayes of this ſpirit of Antichriſt, as found in this people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> or in any other that appear not under that name or form with them, for the ſame ſpirit is working in and walking in by many others.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>1. Que. Their firſt question is, whether do you own that Chriſt hath two Bodies, one in Heaven, and another on Earth, yea or nay?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are two queſtions in this one, Namely, Whether we own that Chriſt hath two Bodies? 2. VVhether one in Heaven, and another on Earth, and in both parts ambigiouſly propounded in ſuch generall and doubtfull tearms, as are capable of divers acceptations, without declaring in what ſence they uſe any of thoſe generall tearms in the query, ſo that it is not capable of receiving a ſingle and direct anſwer as propounded by them. For 1. The word body is uſed diverſly in Scripture, ſometimes for divers members of fleſh and bone compact together, and united in one Perſon to one perſonal Head, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12. 12. 14. 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4. And in this ſence the man hath a body of his own diſtinct from his wives, and the woman a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of her own diſtinct from her huſbands, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 4.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes for divers perſons compact together and united in one politick or myſtical body under one Governour as their head, or for ſuch ſociety, union and fellowſhip made up of divers perſons, as in which they are joyntly ſet and compact together for the good of each other, and therein for others benefit. So the man and his wife are one fleſh, one body (who yet in the ſore mentioned ſence of the word Body, have each their diſtinct body of their own, as we ſhewed) ſee <hi>Mat. 19. 5, 6. Eph. 5. 28. 29. 33. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 16. So alſo divers perſons united, and ſet in order in a Common-wealth, or corporation, under one Head or Government, ſo as each may ſerve for the good of the other, and all joyntly for the good of the
<pb facs="tcp:110170:47"/>
whole; are one body not perſonall, but politick, where every member hath his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſonall body, diſtinct from each other, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 12. with Cap. 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>In ſome anſwerable ſence likewiſe, the words the Body of Chriſt are uſed in Scriptures in a two-ſold ſence, as to ſay, 1. For that body of his fleſh in which the Word was made fleſh, and came and dwelt among men on the Earth, in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members of fleſh and bones, hands and feet were united in one perſonal body, even in that one body, which as in the Counſel of God foreordained from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo in due time was actually prepared for him when he came into the World, by the gift and appointment of the Father, in the power and operation of the Holy Ghoſt; In which he was made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, and in which himſelf bore our ſins on the Tree, dyed, and was buried, and the third Day roſe again, and appeared oft to his Diſciples, and affirmed and demonſtrated himſelf to be that very He, in the ſame body (having fleſh and bones, hands and feet) which they before had ſeen; yea, the ſame in which, while ſome of them beheld him, he was taken up from them, and carryed into Heaven, and there compleated the offering up of himſelf in that his own Body once for all; And in which he remaineth on the right hand of God in Heaven it ſelf, till the times of the Reſtitution of all things, when he will come again, and appear in the ſame body, as viſibly as he went up, and in the Glory he now poſſeſſeth for us in Heaven with the Father, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. with <hi>John 1. 14. Heb.</hi> 10. 5. 10. with <hi>Mat. 1. 18 22. Luke</hi> 1. 34, 35. and <hi>Gal. 4 4. 1 Pet. 2. 24. Luke</hi> 23. 46. 52. 23. and 24. 3. 6, 7. 36. to the end. <hi>John 20. Acts</hi> 1. 9. 11. and 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>His body in this ſence of the word is called the body of his fleſh as diſtinguiſhed from his body in ſuch a ſence, as his Church ſpiritually and by Faith united with him are ſaid to be his body, ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 1 22. 24. And as diſtinguiſhed from our perſonal bodies, that while in this mortal ſtate are vile, the Body of Chriſt in this firſt ſence, as raiſed from the dead and exalted, is called his Glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. laſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame words, the Body of Chriſt, are alſo uſed to expreſſe to us a ſociety or Congregation of many diſtinct perſons united to him by Faith, as their Head and Husband; And ſo all thoſe that by the love of God commended by the Holy Ghoſt through the blood of Chriſt, and the Excellency of Chriſt diſcovered in the Preaching of his Croſſe, are Redeemed and drawn off from other objects, and brought in to believe in him, and ſo united by Faith to him, and in love to him and one another, to be ordered by the Royall Law; Theſe are his Congregation, Houſe, or Church, and ſo his Body, whereof he in his perſonal body is the head. And they (each in their diſtinet perſonal bodies while here on Earth) Spiritually, and by Faith members of him, &amp; in love and fellowſhip members alſo of one another; Even as he that is joyned to a Harlot or Woman is one fleſh, and ſo they twayn are one fleſh, and ſo one body in a fleſhly union, or union in the fleſh; So in ſome anſwerable ſence, he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit, and ſo of that one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the unity of the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. 4. Yea even their particular bodies in this unity of the Spirit are the members of Chriſt, and ſo of the one myſtical body of Chriſt, of his Houſe, Temple or Church, yet each member hath his diſtinct perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall body, diſtinct from each other, and all diſtinct from his perſonal body, in
<pb facs="tcp:110170:48"/>
which he is the head of his body the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 15. 17. Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. with <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5. Again,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. (To have) may be diverſly ſaid, As to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man may have ſomething as part of himſelf, and ſo our Saviour even after his Reſurrection from the dead is ſaid by himſelf to have fleſh &amp; bones, hands and feet, (ſo as a ſpirit hath not) and ſo to have them, as of the eſſence of himſelf, handle me and ſee, that is I my ſelf; For the Word was made fleſh, and therefore even that fleſh or body could not be holden of Death, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 39. <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. with <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 24. 31. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man may have other things, or perſons, as relations to him by marriage, Covenant, or by Blood; So a man is ſaid to have his wife, and the woman her husband, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12. 13. &amp; likewiſe inſtructed to have one another, according to ſuch covenant and relation, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. So perſons are ſaid to have children, or nephews, as relation in the fleſh, though neither is the husband the wife, nor the wife the husband, nor is the child the father, or the father the child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe are diſtinct relations, and diſtinctly related to, and ſo had by each other as well as diſtinct perſons; In ſome anſwerable ſence, it may be ſaid, Jeſus Chriſt hath his Body the Church, as his ſpouſe and children, and they have him as their Head, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Father and Lord, in that Covenant and Relation that is in the unity of the Spirit, as appears by thoſe compariſons and inſtructions from them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 23. 32. with Chap. 4. 4. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet Chriſt is not the Church, but the Head and Husband of it, and ſo neither is he who is the head of his body the Church. A body in ſuch a ſence of himſelf alone, without his members that are ſo Myſtically and Spiritually, I ſay, not in ſuch a ſence as they joyned to him as their head, are ſaid to be his Body. Whence as he in his own perſonal body (now glorified) is the head of a body in the laſt ſence, namely of his body the Church, in ſuch a ſence, and in ſuch conſideration of him, they are ſaid to be his fulneſſe, who yet receives nothing from them, but filleth all in all; But he as the head of the body, and ſo that his body in the laſt ſence is made up and compleated of them, by what they receive from him, and are made in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. 23. And ſo neither are they any of them or all of them together the Chriſt, the head of the Body, or Husband of the Church; But his Body, Church, or Spouſe, as joyned to him Spiritually and by Faith, and members thereof in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. 13. 27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. 25. 32. The having each other in this ſence is not ſuch as confounds the diſtinction of perſons or relations, or makes the one the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. One may alſo truly be ſaid to have things or perſons which yet he hath not in ſuch relation, nor are ſo related to him, and that either in a propriety or intereſt in them, by right of purchaſe, gift, or otherwiſe, or in poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>And ſo according to theſe divers ſences in which theſe words are uſed, we might anſwer to this firſt queſtion, whether Chriſt hath two bodies; In ſome ſences yea, and in others nay.</p>
                  <p>But for the help of others, we anſwer more fully thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If by bodies, be underſtood perſonal bodies, and alſo by having them be meant as in the laſt mentioned ſence in which one may be ſaid to have things, or perſons, as we are left at liberty to take any ſence in which the words are uſed (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſo propounded it out of weakneſſe or wickedneſſe we will not determine)
<pb facs="tcp:110170:48"/>
then thus we anſwer; Chriſt hath an innumerable multitude of bodies as well as ſouls, even the bodies and ſpirits of all men are his, and of right in his diſpoſe; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath intereſt in them by creation, for all things were made by him, and for him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16, 17. and by redemption, for he gave himſelf a ranſom for all, and hath bought them all, even them that deny him, he hath redeemed them from the curſe of the Law, to be under his Government, diſpoſe and judgement; and by means thereof,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath the diſpoſe and dominion of them committed to him; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son, and hath given him authority to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.</p>
                  <p>All things are delivered unto him of his Father, even the Heathen for his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the utmoſt parts of the Earth for his poſſeſſion. And therefore alſo,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſhall inherit all Nations, yea all ſhall be raiſed and judged by him at the laſt day, for to this end Chriſt both dyed, roſe and revived, that he might be Lord of both dead &amp; living, whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 18 <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>John</hi> 12. 31, 32. and 5. 22. 27, 28. <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 7, 8, 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who can number the bodies he hath in this ſence on the Earth, ſurely even theſe deceivers, that privily deny the Lord that bought them, and thoſe deceived by them are all his, and ſhall be judged by him, even by the man Chriſt Jeſus, by whom God hath ordained to judge the World in Righteoueneſſe, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from the dead, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 16. <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. And as for the bodies of thoſe that with the heart believe on him, they are his in a more peculiar manner, even members of him, as is before ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>But, 2. If by Bodies be underſtood perſonal Bodies, and by having be meant, as in the firſt mentioned ſence, his having them as of the eſſence or being of himſelf; Then our anſwer to the queſtion is nay; There are not divers perſonal bodies of Chriſt, not two that may each properly and peculiarly be called the Body of Chriſt, but there is one (which is more then theſe men believe, and that which they privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to deny in theſe queries) and he hath it and continueth in it for ever. And it is the ſame (and no other) that was prepared for him in the womb of the Virgin, in which he appeared once in the laſt ages of the World to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf; And in this his own Body himſelf bore our ſins on the Tree, and being raiſed from the dead the third day, is now paſſed into the Heavens, and there received by the Father, till the times of the reſtitution of all things; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this man continueth for ever, therefore he hath an unchangeable prieſthood, &amp; is now appearing in the preſence of God in the Heaven it ſelf for us, the man Chriſt Jeſus, the Mediator between God and man, and great high Prieſt over the Houſe of God, even Jeſus the Son of God paſſed into the Heavens for us; For if he were on Earth, he were not ſuch a Prieſt as becomes us to have, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 23. 26. and 8. 1. 3 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 10. 5. 12.</p>
                  <p>Again, 3. If Bodies be underſtood in the 2d. ſence of the word body mentioned, namely for ſocieties or congregations of diſtinct perſons united and gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under one head or Governour. And his having them be underſtood in the ſecond ſence of having mentioned, namely by donation and Covenant as his
<pb facs="tcp:110170:49"/>
Church, or Spouſes Then to the queſtion, we further anſwer, That in ſuch a ſence he hath one body, and no more, foraſmuch as he the Head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to whom, being joyned Spiritually, and by Faith they are of his Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body, is but one, that body can be no more but one, for to them all there is but one Head, Husband, and Lord; They are all built upon one foundation, even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, he being the chief corner Stone, in whom the building fitly framed together groweth into an Holy Temple in the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18. 22. So though there be many members, and alſo many particular ſocieties of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers upon Earth, yet they all make but one body, or general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born; Yea all believers now living upon the Earth, and all dead as to the fleſh, even all the dead in Chriſt that ſleep in Jeſus, whoſe ſpirits are made perfect are but one body of Chriſt, in that ſence of the word bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 18. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. 25. And this his body may be ſaid to be partly in Heaven, partly on Earth, for there in Heaven with him are the ſpirits of Juſt men made perfect; Unto whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, thoſe unfeigned believers living upon the Earth are come by Faith, which is the evidence of things not ſeen, the confidence of things hoped for, and ſo Spiritually and by Faith have their converſation in Heaven, from whence alſo they look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change their vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his Glorious body.</p>
                  <p>So then, the body of Chriſt is but one in any one ſence of the word body, though as the word body is uſed in divers ſences, he hath a body which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly called his Body, or the body of Chriſt in two ſences; As the head of ſome believing women is ſpoken of in a threefold ſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. her perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all head, her husband, and Chriſt; yet in proper and ſtrict ſpeaking ſhe hath but one head, becauſe her head is but one in any one ſence of the word head, but one perſonal head, but one husband, but one Chriſt, yet her head in each of theſe ſences is diſtinct, yea every member of the Body of Chriſt the Church hath a perſonal head of their naturall body diſtinct from Chriſt the myſtical head of them all.</p>
                  <p>So hath Chriſt a perſonal body, and members called the body of his Fleſh, his now Glorious Body, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. Diſtinct from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. elſe he could be no meet or proper head for ſuch a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or Congregation where every member hath a particular perſonal body and members diſtinct. But take body in any one ſence of the word Body, and there is not two but one Body of Chriſt, as before is ſhewed, nor indeed are any of his Body the Church, but ſuch as are by Faith united and joyned unto that one Lord in that his one perſonal body now Glorified with the Father, as their Head, Lord, and Husband, Nor are the head and members divided, but their union is ſpiritual, and by Faith, not ſenſual; The head is the fore-runner, and in that his own perſonal body in which he bore our ſins, and is the head of his body the Church; He is already entred into Heaven, whether the members in their particular bodies are not in a like ſence entered, but by Faith and hope do enter, and ſo have their converſation in Heaven from whence they look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change their vile body, that it may be faſhioned into the likenſſe of his Glorious Body, for here they walk by Faith, and not by ſight. And while they are at home in the clay Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:49"/>
fleſh, or natural body, they are abſent from the Lord, in a like ſence as at home in the body, they are not otherwiſe preſent with him now, but in Spirit, and by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3. 10. 14. and 6. 19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 37, 38. <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 20, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>Such therefore are not of the true Church or body of Chriſt but of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt as are vainly puft up with their ſenſual minde, not holding the Head, <hi>&amp;c. Col.</hi> 2. 18, 19. And that theſe men are ſuch appeares in their ſeeking to inſinuate by this query, and the reſt, that to believe and acknowledge that the man Chriſt Jeſus continues, even in that body of his fleſh now Glorified with the Father, as the Head of the Church, in a perſonal being diſtinct from his body the Church, and from every member thereof, is to make Chriſt to have two Bodies, one in Heaven, and another on Earth; and therefore they endeavour privily to make a nullity of his perſonal body, the body of his fleſh, or to deny his ſtill having it, and poſſeſſing now in it that Glory which he had with the Father before the World was, and ſo hold not the head, foraſmuch as he is not otherwiſe the Head of his Body the Church; But as now he is in that perſonal body Glorified, and becauſe this man continues ever in that Name and Glory of his Father, which through ſufferings in the ſame Body he hath obtained for us, that by him our Faith and Hope might be in God.</p>
                  <p>We have been the larger in this firſt Anſwer, as well to help the weak in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding things that differ, or are diſtinct, that ſo they may diſcern and approve things that are excellent, as alſo to ſhew the corruptneſſe of their way, in confounding things clearly diſtinct and diſtinguiſhed in the Scripture, and ſeeking by ſuch confuſion, to work their ends in deceiving the ſimple, which alſo may further appeare in their following Queries, and the more eaſily by the help of what hath been ſaid in anſwer to this.</p>

It alſo takes that for granted as the ground of it, which is not granted by us in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, it being no where ſo expreſſed in the Scripture, of the body of Chriſt in either ſence; Namely, That the body of Chriſt is the fulneſſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Of him in his own perſonal body, in which he is the Head of his body the Church, the Scriptures ſaith, in him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. with Capter 1. 19. Not that his body is the fulneſſe of God, or of the God-head, but that dwells in him bodily, that ſo of his fulneſſe, we might receive.</p>
                  <p>And of his Body the Church, he ſaith it is his fulneſſe, namely, the fulneſs of Chriſt, as he is the Head of a Body, <hi>viz.</hi> of an union of many perſons in one Body; now although that head be God bleſſed for ever, and he and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:110170:50"/>
are one (though diſtinct in reſpect of the manner of their being in the God-head, and as ſo diſtinct as Chriſt is the Head of the Church, ſo the Head of Chriſt is God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. So although Chriſt who is the Head of the Church, be God) yet the Church is not ſaid to be his fulneſſe ſimply as he is God, but as he is the Head of the Church, and that is, as he is God man in one Perſon, the Man Chriſt Jeſus now raiſed from the dead, and continuing ever with the the Father, even as ſo conſidered he is the Fountain of all fulneſſe for us, and filleth all in all, compare <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 20. 23. with chap. 4. 8, 9, 10 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. 19. and 2. 9. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 23, 24, 25. as ſo conſidered he is the Head of the Church, and as he in that his perſonal body is the Head and Husband, ſo the Church is his fulneſſe, even as <hi>Eve</hi> was <hi>Adams,</hi> or as the Natural Body is the Heads fulneſſe, the Church is that in which is the fulneſſe, or compleating of him as he is the Head of a body, <hi>viz.</hi> of an union of many perſons in one body, for ſo as we have ſhewed before, he could not have a Body in ſuch a ſence, had he not members, many Perſons united to himſelf as their Head, Governour and Husband. Further alſo their <hi>Querie</hi> is perverſe and corrupt, in that it intimately charges us, as calling the Perſonal Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, now Glorified a Body of fleſh and bones, which is a ſlander, for it is not our expreſſion, but theirs uſed oft by way of deriſion and reproach of him; and though poſſibly we may ſometimes have let it paſs without conſideration or particular notice of it, in ſome diſcourſe that may have paſſed between us, yet the expreſſion we own not, but ſay with the Scripture, That the Perſonal Body of Chriſt hath fleſh and bones, hands and feet, even the ſame in which he once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, truly called the Body of his fleſh, and in that very body, he is now glorified; yea this we have divers times aſſerted to them in anſwer to ſuch their deriding expreſſions, and ſtill do aſſert, that the Perſonal Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for which we contend, is not a body without a ſpirit, which a body of fleſh and bones may be; yet we are ſo far from being aſhamed of the Words of Chriſt, and bearing the reproach caſt upon his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body by them; That as we know and believe as the Scripture hath ſaid, ſo we confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt was made of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> after the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. made of a woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. and ſo took part of fleſh and blood with mankind, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. and ſo he dyed as man mortal, but he roſe again the ſame body ſpiritual and immortal, his Body not a ſpirit, though ſpiritual, yet truly a body, yea the body of a man, and in that ſence humane. The ſame he that dyed and was buried, is riſen and aſcended, having fleſh and bones, even ſuch as before his aſcention was ſeen and handled by his Diſciples, and ſo himſelf ſaith of himſelf, and did walk, ſpeak and eat before them, and ſhewed them his hands and his feet to confirm the ſame, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 36. 44. <hi>John</hi> 20. and 21. And while he bleſſed them and they beheld him, he was parted from them, and carried up into Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 50, 51. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11. And as his Diſciples that ſaw were bleſſed, ſo he hath alſo pronounced them bleſſed that have not ſo ſeen and yet believe, <hi>John</hi> 20. 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. ſo that though we call not his perſonal body a body of fleſh and bones, yet believing his ſayings, we are not aſhamed to confeſſe he hath fleſh and bones, though not
<pb facs="tcp:110170:50"/>
carnal or mortal like mortal men, whole life is in then blood, and may be let out with a Sword, and muſt die; But his, though humane, yet ſpiritual and immortal, and becauſe of that ſuffered, and done by him in that Body in which he hath overcome death, and ſo received gifts in the man; its by way of Eminency and Peculiarity called his fleſh and his bones, and he in that body is in the Heaven of Heavens, nor is there any but the Spirit of Satan in Antichriſt that will move any to deny or reproach this as theſe do.</p>
                  <p>From all which conſiderations, we refuſe this Queſtion as thus ſtated by them, as fooliſh, unlearned, corrupt and prophane; But yet for the help of the weak, if it be queried what is that his Body of which he is ſaid to be the Head, and which is ſaid to be his fulneſſe as he is the Head, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, Not his Body in the firſt ſence, but in the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> not ſuch an union of many Members in one Body, as in which they are all united in one perſon or perſonal body; but the union of many perſons (believers or Perſons ſo imputed) that have each a diſtinct perſonal Body, in one myſtical body, Church or Congregation under that one head, who hath alſo a diſtinct perſonal body of his own in which he is the head, and alſo the Saviour of that his Body, the Church, ſee the Text, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22, 23. with chap. 5. 23. 28.</p>
                  <p>If it be further Queried, whether the Body of Chriſt in this ſence or his Body the Church have fleſh and bones, its already anſwered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He who is the Head of it hath a diſtinct Body that hath fleſh and bones (now glorified) in which he is the Head.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>If yet further any Querie whether this Body be in Heaven, it is likewiſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy anſwered,</p>
                  <p>The Head who is their forerunner is already entered, and ſo they in him as in their head, and with him by the faith of the operation of God who hath raiſed him (he ſaith not them) his own perſonal Body (not theirs) from the dead, ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. and Chap. 2. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 19 20. with Chap. 4. 3. But they in their particular bodies are not ſo entered, but while at home in the fleſh or natural Body, in its mortal ſtate are abſent from the Lord (as is ſhewed in the Anſwer to their firſt Queries) nor are they meet ſo to enter, for fleſh and blood (man in his preſent mortal and unchanged ſtate) cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption, and they are yet dead (though Chriſt be in them, and the ſpirit made alive in a firſt fruits becauſe of Righteouſneſſe, yet) the body is dead becauſe of ſin; and ſo even they that have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, are yet waiting for the adoption, that is, the Redemption of the Body; for their life is yet hid with Chriſt in God, when Chriſt who is their life ſhall appear, then ſhall they alſo appear with him in glory, having their vile bodies faſhioned into the likeneſſe of his Glorious Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23, 24 and 3. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. 23. with <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. 53.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this Querie is firſt an intimate acknowledgement (though it may ſeem in a deriding way of Chriſts ſuffering in a Body of fleſh and bones) But the intention of this Querie with the following, is to deny and reproach the acknowledgement of the Reſurrection of Chriſt and his aſcention into Heaven in that very body in which he ſuffered, dyed and was buried, in the denyal of which his perſonal Croſs of ſufferings is made of none effect. The Apoſtles Preaching rendred vain and falſe, and faith in him of no effect, yea the general Reſurrection of the dead is alſo herein denyed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 13. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to this purpoſe there is an Argument contained in this Querie, by which they would inforce the denial of the foreſaid acknowledgement of the Reſurrection and Aſcention of Jeſus the Lord, in that body of his fleſh in which he ſuffered, <hi>viz.</hi> That that body in which he ſuffered in the fleſh, did not deſcend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the lower parts of the earth, and therefore neither is that aſcended up to Heaven, ſeeing no man hath aſcended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that here is more then a Querie, even an Argument from their intimate and implyed denial of the deſcenſion of that body, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the denial of his aſcention, the corruption and fooliſhneſſe of which we ſhall ſhew in our anſwer to the Querie; to which we ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scriptures they mention give this plain anſwer, That he, even the Son of man came down from Heaven and deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, which we believing do therefore confeſs as the Scripture hath ſaid; for although that his perſonal Body in which he was made man and became the ſon of man was actually prepared for him, or the preparation of it was made in the earth, according to that prophetical ſpeaking of it long before (in which by a word in the time paſt firſt, &amp; another expreſſion in the time to come following, it is ſignified to be then vertually, but not actually done) the Lord hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a new thing in the earth, a woman ſhall compaſs a man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 22. for he was made fleſh of a woman, <hi>John 1. 14. Rom. 1. 3. Gal.</hi> 4 4 and therein curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly framed in the lower parts of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139 15. And ſo as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Body, as of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> it was not before materially exiſtent in Heaven, otherwiſe then in the Counſel of God decreeing and fore ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and power effecting it, and word made fleſh in it, yet the Son of man is truly ſaid to come down from Heaven, to have come forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe that Eternal Word, the only begotten Son of God, that was made fleſh, in that one body prepared for him, and is now become the Son of man, He came down from Heaven; for the Word was in being before he was made fleſh, he was in the beginning with God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2. And that word not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took or entered into fleſh, but was made fleſh, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. So as the Word that was in the beginning, and the fleſh which in due time he was made (and ſo is not now in making) is one perſon, one Son, who is both the Son of God, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110170:51"/>
the Son of man, yea the two natures, that of God and that of man (though diſtinct and not confounded) are united in one perſon, ſo as what is ſaid of either nature, may (though not in reſpect of the nature, yet) in reſpect of perſon be ſaid of both. As for inſtance; In reſpect of the nature of man, and as man, and as pertaining to the fleſh which he was made, he dyed, 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2. 24. and 3. 18. and 4. 1. (not is dying or ſuffering in that perſonal Body of his, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18.) yet in reſpect of the perſon, and becauſe of the union of the two natures in one perſon, his ſufferings or blood is truly called Gods own Blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and ſo its ſaid, God laid down his life for us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. ſo in this buſineſſe, the Son of man came down from Heaven, in as much as he, that perſon, that is the Son of man, the Eternal Word and onely begotten Son of God that was made fleſh, he deſcended and came forth from the Father, and came down from Heaven; Yea alſo, when he was on earth in his Body, and not as then in that reſpect aſcended, yet then when he as God, the Son of God, the word (that was made fleſh) in Heaven with the Father, yea likewiſe in the vertue and preciouſneſſe of his being the Son of man, and what he had undertaken to do in that Body on the Earth, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. with chap. 6. 62. and 20. 17. had theſe men known and believed, that very Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> of the Seed of <hi>David, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, &amp;c.</hi> after the Fleſh, to be indeed the Lord from Heaven, God bleſſed for ever, and yet alſo true and very man, both in one perſon, and ſo <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us or in our nature for us, they would not have made this querie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But for further anſwer, we add, That the Scriptures alleadged by them give no ground for their Querie, whither that body did deſcend from Heaven, becauſe they ſpake not in ſuch phraſe or manner of ſpeech as might be limitted to one of the natures onely, for he ſaith not ſimply it or the ſame thing that deſcended (as they would inſinuate) but he or that perſon that deſcended, he is the ſame that aſcended up, and the perſon that deſcended is, God man, the word made fleſh in an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble union, for God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, and he humbled himſelf to death in the fleſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 9, 10. Further alſo,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſaith, <hi>That he that aſcended is the ſame that deſcended into the lower parts of the earth,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>not ſimply, or onely that he is the ſame that deſcended or came down from Heaven,</hi> but further, <hi>that he is the ſame that deſcended into the lower parts of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though in that firſt act of his deſcention and abaſement in which he was made fleſh of a woman, he might (as we hinted before) be ſaid to deſcend into, and be curiouſly wrought or framed in the lower parts of the earth, yet did he alſo deſcend into the lower parts of the earth, in other and further ſences, and in further and following acts of his abaſement, in all which he was abaſed and humbled in that body of his fleſh which he had taken or was made in the womb of the Virgin; Now his deſcention into the lower parts of the earth was firſt, even to the utmoſt ſtep or point of it before his aſcention there ſpoken of, and after the Declaration of that tis ſaid, <hi>He that deſcended</hi> (namely into the lower parts of the earth, even in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſence in which he did ſo) <hi>he is the ſame that aſcended up far above all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he that was made ſin and made a curſe for us, that humbled himſelf and became obedient to the death of the Croſs, that dyed and was buried, all which (as we ſhall further ſhew anon) is evidently included in his deſcending into the lower
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110170:52"/>
parts of the earth, he is Gods Son, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, not onely as the eternal word ſimply conſidered, but as made fleſh of a woman, and ſo made of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> after the fleſh, and made under the law for us; And that he that ſo deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, and after the ſame conſideration of him, even Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, that that very he was raiſed in that very Body in which he Suffered, having the ſame ſubſtance, fleſh and bones, hands and feet (though not in the ſame quality) and therein mightily declared to be the Son of God in that raiſed Body Spiritual and immortal and carried up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yea that this man continues for ever, we have already particularly proved and ſhewed by the Scriptures, and ſhall further do it as we have occaſion in anſwer to theſe Queries; nor are they able to reſiſt the wiſdom and Spirit in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which this great thing of Gods Doctrine concerning Chriſt is evidently ſet forth, and therefore ſeek privily to undermine and deny it by this ſnaring querie (with the Argument annexed as before expreſſed) whither did that body deſcend from Heaven? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which likewiſe we give this further anſwer; 4. He, even the Son of man, yea that body of his fleſh in which he was made and became the Son of man might be, and is truly ſaid to have come down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> thus, or in theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that the grace, appointment and gift in which he was given and ſent forth to be ſo made fleſh and humbled in that body was from <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> gave and ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, and ſo to be the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our ſins, and he came forth from the <hi>Father,</hi> and came into the World, <hi>Joh. 3. 14. 16, 17. Gal. 4. 4. 1 John 4. 9, 10 John</hi> 16. 28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that the power by which he was made fleſh in that one body prepared him was from <hi>Heaven;</hi> for the Birth of Jeſus was on this wiſe, <hi>The Holy Ghost did come upon a woman, a Virgin that had not known man, and the Power of the Highest did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow her, and ſhe was found with child of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in her was of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> Therefore alſo that holy Thing that was born of her was called <hi>The Son of the Highest, Mat. 1. 18. 21. Luke</hi> 1. 31. 35.</p>
                  <p>And ſo even the Son of man, yea that body of his fleſh prepared for him on the earth, in which he was made and became the Son of man, deſcended and came forth from <hi>Heaven</hi> and came into the world; forasmuch as he ſo came forth and was made fleſh by the grace, gift and appointment of the <hi>Father,</hi> and by the operation of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and in that body of his fleſh he deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, and he that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcended up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

But the intention of this Querie (by comparing it with the reſt of their confuſions of this nature) appears to be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſuppoſe or implie this as the queſtion, <hi>Whether he that aſcended up far above all Heavens be a perſon of fleſh and bones, the ſame that deſcended into the lower parts of the earth;</hi> and then by that which follows as the main querie in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110170:53"/>
to enforce a Negative anſwer, by rendering the acknowledgement of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as being in that his own body in Heaven it ſelf abſurd and fooliſh, becauſe they think in their fooliſh imagination, that to acknowledge him to be ſo in Heaven, and yet alſo far above all Heavens, cannot ſtand together.</p>
                  <p>Their inward thought (its like) is by theſe perverſe diſputings, to draw us into ſome ſnare or confuſion, that they may glory over us and get advantage to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to ſuch as will liſten to them, that the plain declarations of theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Man Chriſt Jeſus in the Scriptures are but cunningly Deviſed fables, that muſt have ſome other Moral or Myſterie according to the Senſual or fleſhly mind, in which they are vainly puft up, not holding the head; however we ſhall put it to the iſſue, giving our anſwers plainly and without hidden things of diſhoneſty, as thoſe that have received a word of truth, a faithful ſaying worthy to be ſtuck too, and of which we are not aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>And ſo firſt to their ſuppoſition laid down as the ground of their following que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>If he which deſcended, &amp;c. be a perſon of fleſh and bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we ſay, firſt we know no perſon made up or wholly conſiſting of fleſh and bones, much leſſe is his who is God man, the onely begotten Son of God, even as now made fleſh and ſo as the Son of Man, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. now glorified with the Fathers own Self, as the Fruits of his Sufferings, for in him<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9.</note> dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the God head bodily, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4, 5. Therefore we reject their abſurb expreſſion as fooliſh and impious, proceeding from their ſcorn of him and enmity to him, though they in reproach and deriſion of us for his Sake would intimate it as ours, as a little before that other expreſſion (not altogether ſo groſſe as this) a body of fleſh and bones, to which having ſpoken already, we add no more to this, But further aſſert in anſwer to their querie implyed in the Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>That the Son of Man, even Chriſt of the Seed of <hi>David, Abraham,</hi> yea of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> after the fleſh, in that body of his fleſh (prepared for him when he came into the World) in which he was ſent forth, made of a Woman, made under the Law, he being found in faſhion as a man in the likeneſſe of ſinſul fleſh (though without ſin) and in the form of a Servant, did alſo deſcend into the lower parts of the earth, even in the two laſt ſences of the lower parts of the earth before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For as <hi>Jonas</hi> was three dayes and three nights in the belly of the Whale, ſo was the Son of Man (in his finiſhing the works the Father gave him to do on the earth) three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 40.</p>
                  <p>In that Body of his fleſh he bore the Judgement of this World, even that due to us for ſin, in which he was made for a time the baniſhed or forſaken one, and his Soul therein made an offering for our ſin, <hi>John</hi> 12. 27. 31. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:110170:53"/>

His ſoul was not left in hell, neither did his fleſh ſee corruption as <hi>Davids</hi> did, but God raiſed him the third day (even him whom they flew and hung on a tree, and took down from the tree, and laid in a Sepulcher, God raiſed him from the dead) and ſhewed him openly, not to all the people, but to witneſſes choſen before of God, even to thoſe laſt Apoſtles who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 39. 40, 41. and 13. 29. 30 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 37.</p>
                  <p>To whom he ſhewed himſelf alive after his paſſion (even himſelf that ſuffered to death in the fleſh, alive after his ſuffering) by many infalible proofs, (being ſeen of them fourty dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) In all which he demonſtrated himſelf to them, to be the ſame perſon, and in the ſame Body, yea to have the ſame fleſh and bones, hands and feet in which he dwelt among them, and walked up and down with them, in the dayes of his fleſh (or weakneſſe) and in which he was crucified through weakneſſe; And that now in the ſame Body he did live again, by the Power of God, and in the Glory of his Father, and did or preſently ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up, and go away from them to the Father, to appear in the preſence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Heaven it ſelf for them, to prepare a place for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that from thence he might even in the ſame body, in the Name and Glory of his Father, deſcend, or come down again, and receive them to himſelf, with all elſe, who through his Grace (bringing Salvation to all men in due time) do love and waite for that his Glorious appearing, that they may be with him for ever; See the Scriptures before mentioned to this purpoſe, how after his Reſurrection he did evidently demonſtrate himſelf to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 36. to the end. And to <hi>Thomas</hi> particularly, who not being with the reſt when they had ſeen the Lord, had ſaid to them, <hi>except I ſhall ſee in his hands, and put my finger into the print of the nayles, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe;</hi> See what follows, <hi>John</hi> 20. 24, to the end. For even thoſe things are written, that we in after ages that have not ſo ſeen him might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing we might have life through his Name; See alſo how further he aſſerts concerning his Aſcenſion and going away from them to the Father, <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. with Chapter 14. 3. 28. and 16. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 28.</p>
                  <p>And that the ſame Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> even Chriſt of the fruit of <hi>Davids</hi> loyns after the fleſh, (for the name Jeſus was not given him, or not ſo as that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it, till he had taken and was made fleſh, and it alwayes ſignifies that perſon as ſo made, and includes the body of his fleſh.) That he in the ſame Body did Aſcend and was parted from them, after he had ſo ſhewed himſelf unto them, and was carried, and received up into Heaven, even as he had ſaid unto them; See the Scriptures, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>And the man Chriſt Jeſus is the one Mediator between God and men, even he the ſame, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, and is not any more to be offered in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or to give himſelf a Ranſome for us; But to be teſtified to us in due time.</p>

                  <head>Queſt. <hi>What is that place he is in, far above all Heavens which is not Heaven?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This queſtion is fooliſh, and unlearned, for aſmuch as it takes for granted either as our minde, or ſaying, or as the expreſſion of the Scripture, that there is ſome place far above all Heavens which is not Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Whereas neither is this any ſaying of ours, nor any where in the Scripture, but their filly inference; Nor is there any ground for their queſtion in the words of the Scripture, which they ſeem to allude to. For that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 10. ſpeaks not expreſly of a place far above all Heavens, but of a perſon; He that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above all Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſure its underſtandable enough, that a perſon exalted to great Glory and dignity may be far above the place of his Habitation, where he poſſeſſeth it; Yea is it not ſaid of God that made the Heavens and the Earth, that Heaven is his Throne upon which he ſitteth, <hi>Mat</hi> 23. 22. the place of his Habitation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 14. And yet ſure the Creator is infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above and greater than the Creature, yea he hath ſet his Glory above the Heavens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
                  <p>This Queſtion therefore as ſtated by them, we may juſtly reject as a fooliſh and perverſe diſputing of men of corrupt mindes deſtitute of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Yet we ſhall here alſo, as alwayes by the Grace of God with ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity clearly aſſert, and ſhew by the Scriptures the Truth of God againſt their privy endeavours to caſt down the man Chriſt Jeſus from his Excellency. And ſo we ſay,</p>
                  <p>The place or places where he now poſſeſſeth his Glory in that body of his fleſh for us, is the Heaven it ſelfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. (The place of the Habitation, or Throne of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 13. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 22. For he is with him appearing in the preſence of his Glory for us in Heaven it ſelf, when we cannot in ſuch wiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for our ſelves, nor in our own perſons, while at whom in the body in its mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtate) he is ſet on the Right hand of the Throne of Majeſty in the Heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1. into which he is paſſed, and gone up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>And yet therein, he may be truly and properly ſaid to be aſcended, or gone up far above all Heavens, not only in reſpect of Glory and Dignity, but even in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of place, or local height alſo; When it ſelf the Heaven, or Heaven of heavens, the place, or places on high, whether he is gone up, is diſtinctly mentioned in the ſame Scripture and ſpeech, as it is in that <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. 10. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended on high, ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 8. far above all Heavens, ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Now as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth us to argue, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27. But when he ſaith, all things are put under him, its manifeſt that he is excepted that did put all things under him; So we may ſay here when he ſaith, he is aſcended on high far above all Heavens, it appears that the place, or places on high where he poſſeſſeth this Glory for us, is excepted from thoſe all Heavens far above which he is locally aſcended, or gone up; And ſo we read of the Heaven of heavens, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 27. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 6. Sometimes alſo called the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110170:54"/>
Heavens of heavens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 4. And alſo that Chriſt of the fruits of <hi>Davids</hi> loyns after the fleſh is aſcended on high far above all Heavens, even into Heaven it ſelf, the Heaven or Heavens, of heavens where he is received till the times of reſtitution, now to appear in the preſence of God for us, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 30. 32. 34. and 3. 21 <hi>Heb</hi> 9 24</p>
                  <p>Again if we take in a figurative ſence of the word Heavens as included in that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 10. that is to ſay, if we underſtand them to ſignifie not only the Heavens or heavenly places, but thoſe that dwell in them, in any ſence one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well we may yet in ſaying he is aſcended far above all Heavens in ſuch a ſence, namely exalted in ſtate and dignity far above all Principality and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every name that is named, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 21. We or the Scripture do not therein ſay, either that he is exalted above the Father that exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thither, or that becauſe he is exalted far above all principality and power, and every name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore he is ſet in no principality or power, or hath no name; But that God hath given him a name above every name, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Namely above every other name, and ſo that he is gone into Heaven, and is on the Right hand of God, Angels, Authorities and Powers, yea all things being made ſubject to him by the Father, but ſtill its evident he is excepted that made all things ſubject, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27.</p>
                  <p>We may ſee the darkneſſe and confuſion of the Light in them, by its dictating to them, and leading them into ſuch corrupt and fooliſh inferences, as that becauſe he is aſcended on High far above all Heavens, therefore the place he is in muſt be no Heaven. The ſame (as to the nature or manner of infering) with ſuch as theſe that follow; That becauſe God preferred <hi>Iſrael</hi> above all Nations on the Earth which he had made, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 2. and 26, 19. Therefore they were no Nation on the Earth, or of his making; And ſo becauſe the Lord is above, and greater then all gods, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 9. and 135. 5. Therefore he is not God; who ſees not the weakneſſe and corruption of ſuch reaſoning? If any ſay, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> in other places is called a People, and a Nation, And the Lord in other places is called God.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, Its as evident that the place or places on high where the raiſed body of Chriſt entered and is received, and remaineth until the Reſtitution of all things, is in other places frequently called heaven, the Heavens, the Heaven it ſelf, as in the Scriptures forementioned and others.</p>
                  <p>But it may ſeem their underſtandings told them a body muſt have a place, and therefore that they might privily deny the being of his perſonal and now Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body, and ſo that this man continues for ever, they deviſed this inference to ſee if they could drive us into a confuſion about the place where he is, as alſo the two following queſtions.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This querie hath three parts; To the firſt, whether all the Heavens are local places? We anſwer, if places, then locall, ſeeing local ſignifies places.</p>
                  <p>To the 2d. part, whether one above another? We anſwer, all the Heavens cannot be one above another, for thoſe that be the lower cannot be above the higher, but there are lower and higher, there are heavens, and the Heaven of heavens, as we ſhewed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:110170:55"/>
before. Yea <hi>Stephen</hi> (being full of the Holy Ghoſt) ſaw the Heavens opened, and the Son of man ſtanding on the Right hand of God in Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55, 56.</p>
                  <p>To the laſt part, whether above the Firmament called Heaven? If they mean whether they be all above it, we Anſwer, Nay; ſeeing that is one Heaven, and it is not above it ſelf; But if they would querie, whether any be above it? We Anſwer, yea. And might ſhew it in that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 1. 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 26. with other Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>But all this queſtion upon queſtion is nothing to the purpoſe as to the thing aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by them, nor would it if it had been more properly propounded, or ſtated; as to ſay,</p>
                  <p>If this be the queſtion, whether the word heaven or heavens be alwayes uſed in a proper ſence, to expreſs to us ſome place or places of Glory above the Earth, and one above and exceeding another? and if to this we anſwer, as well we might, Nay; the words are ſometimes uſed figuratively, to expreſſe to us the dwellers in heaven of divers ſorts and degrees, as likewiſe we finde other proper names of places frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed figuratively, as the houſe for the houſhold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſometimes Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically.</p>
                  <p>What then? Doth it follow hence that ſuch words are never uſed in Scripture in their direct and proper ſence, or that they are not ſo uſed, and ſo to be underſtood in thoſe Scriptures that treat of the matter under conſideration?</p>
                  <p>Is this a good Argument? That if it be not evident that the word heaven, or heavens, doth alwayes ſignifie ſome place, or places of Glory diſtinct from, and above the Earth; That then it muſt not be ſo underſtood when Chriſts being aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and gone into heaven is ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that this is the thing they drive at in this and the laſt queſtion is evident; But what their arguing availes to it, let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>Their queſtion (but that they have a deſigne in hand they are aſhamed of, or afraid to diſcover) ſhould have been plain and direct to the buſineſſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is meant by heaven, or heavens, when Chriſts aſcending up thither, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone, or taken up into them, and received, and ſet down there on the Right hand of power is ſpoken of, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1. and 4. 14. and 9. 24. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 51. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. with other like Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>And to this our anſwer is, that then by heaven, or heavens, is meant a place or places on high, diſtinct from other places, yea diſtinct from and above the Earth, and theſe heavens within our ſight, or that we are capable of conſidering ſenſibly in our mind.</p>
                  <p>Yea though as we have ſaid, where it is ſaid he is aſcended on high far above all heavens, there a figurative ſence of heavens is included, yet in ſuch places where his being gone up into heaven, and there received, and ſet on the Right hand of Majeſtie even in the heavens is ſpoken of, there ſuch a figurative ſence cannot be included, as in the other ſaying forementioned; for he is not in ſuch a ſence received into or being in the dwellers in heaven as he is ſaid to be received into, and to be in heaven it ſelf. 1. Not in believers here on Earth, who having their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven, may yet be ſaid Spiritually to dwell in heaven; But Chriſt is not in or among them bodily, in his Glorious body, but Spiritually, and by Faith, nor doth he ſo appear in them, with or among them as in beaven, for there he appears in the preſence of God perſonally, in that his own body, the body of his fleſh, in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110170:55"/>
which he bore our ſins on the tree, not ſo in, with or among them now, but by his Spirit which he calls another Comforter, as diſtinguiſhed from his own perſon, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. 18. 26. They ſee him not as the Apoſtles and firſt witneſſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5. 8. <hi>John</hi> 20. 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. But in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit through their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>They have him not with them, as, or in ſuch a ſence as they have the poor with them, <hi>viz.</hi> in bodily preſence; Yea, they are abſent from him, while at home in the body, even in a like ſence (as aforeſaid) as at home in the body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is he gone up into, or received in Angels, and ſo ſet on the Right hand of Power in them, but paſſed and gone into Heaven far above all Principallity and Power, Angels and Authorities being made ſubject to him.</p>
                  <p>Nor can Heaven in ſuch places as forementioned mean any State of Glory, or Dignity, as diſtinct from the place where he poſſeſſeth it; for it is ſaid he ſhall deſcend or come down from heaven, (where he is now received till the reſtitution of all things) 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 20. 21.

                  <p>And the Text ſaith not, that his body fills or might fill all things, but he for whom God prepared that body, and who in that body is aſcended up far above all Heavens, and is not now on the Earth in his Glorious perſonal Bodily preſence, nor ſaith it that he doth fill all things, but he is aſcended that he might fill or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all things.</p>
                  <p>The intention of this query with the former, is to deny the being of the perſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or that this Man continues for ever, ſo as the former prieſts did not by reaſon of Death.</p>
                  <p>And the Argument here from which they would urge that denyall is, becauſe it is ſaid, he is aſcended that he might fill all things, but a body of Fleſh and Bones cannot be in divers places at once, and ſo not fill all things, therefore hence they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:110170:56"/>
would imply, That he hath no ſuch body, the corruption and folly of both which, their implyed denyal and Argument intimated is already manifeſt, in what hath been ſaid to their deriding expreſſions, a body of fleſh and bones.

                  <p>Humane is alwayes uſed for the Nature or kind of man, as Gods Creature, as diſtinguiſhed from other kinds of Creatures; And ſo a humane body is the body of a man, one that is verily a man, whether ſinful and mortal, or not ſo, either the one or the other.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the Body of <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency was humane, the body of a man, he was verily man, yet ſinleſs, and ſo not ſubject to or in a ſtate of Death (though ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of becoming Immortal, or mortal) but when by ſinning he fell from God, then he became ſinfult and mortal, And ſuch are all that by natural propagation come from him, as of and from him while in this body not changed by Death, yet ſtill humane, the nature or kinde remains though degenerated and corrupt; God made man upright, and tis man ſtill that hath ſought out inventions and is become car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal, ſold under ſin, <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 7. 21. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 1. 2. and Chap. 8. 21.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:110170:57"/>
even from the firſt of his being made man, for though his Body prepared for and taken by him when the word was made fleſh, was humane of mankinde, and ſo he was a very man, Yet he came not by propagation from <hi>Adam,</hi> but though made of a woman of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> was, yet it was in a ſupernatural way, a work of new Creation by the operation of the holy Ghoſt in the womb of a Virgin that had not known man, and was holy, being anointed of God with the Holy Ghoſt, and power even in and from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Birth; And ſo that holy thing, even before born of her, and when born, and alwayes without ſin, yet not Immortal, but for a time partakers of Fleſh and Blood, as the Natural Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> and becauſe therein he was made ſubject to our infirmities that came on us naturally, or as a natural heritage from <hi>Adam,</hi> by reaſon of ſin (yet without ſin) he was ſaid to be made in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and his body might be ſaid in ſome ſence to be made a natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (as being partakers with us of Fleſh and Blood, and ſo mortal) though not in every ſence or in a full ſence, as the naturall Children of <hi>Adam</hi> are. Yet to eſteem him ſinful Fleſh, or his body a carnal Body, even then when he was on Earth partakers of Fleſh and Blood, and ſuffered in the Fleſh, we account blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; much more to eſteem his raiſed and Glorified body in Heaven a carnal body.

                  <p>Yet ſtill this raiſed and Glorious body is humane, the body of a man, even the man Chriſt Jeſus having <hi>Fleſh</hi> and bones, hands and feet, which by way of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from others, and eminency above them, is called his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1.

and decaying ſtate (which may ſtand with carnality in Scripture ſence, though diſtinct from it) becauſe all fleſh in its preſent ſtate is as Graſs, and the goodlineſſe thereof as the flower of the Field fading and withering, but the word of the Lord that was made fleſh, who is the ſpiritual and heavenly man, and he abides for ever; Yea though alſo ſometimes a fleſhly Mind and fleſhly Luſts are equivalent with carnal mindedneſs and luſts, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. to 8. <hi>Col. 2. 18. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To have fleſh and to be fleſhly or named after it, is two things, whether we take fleſh as ſignifying the outward man, or body of man that hath fleſh and bones, and that whether as natural from <hi>Adam,</hi> or as raiſed from the dead, for there is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body, and both have fleſh, though not of or in the ſame quality, or if we take fleſh as Signifying the natural Sinfulneſs, or carnal mind, as the word is uſed for both, yet to have fleſh in either ſence, and to be fleſhly or named after the fleſh, are not the ſame, nor alwayes meeting in the ſame perſon. The Apoſtles did live and walk in the fleſh or natural body, yet did not war after the fleſh, nor was fleſhly or carnal in their knowings, ſpeakings or actings, 2 Cor. 10. 3, 4. with chap. 1, 12, 13 and 5. 16. <hi>Gal</hi> 2 20. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And if to have fleſh and to be fleſhly be not the ſame, nor doth the latter at all neceſſarily follow upon the former in mortal men, How durſt theſe men ſpeak of them, as neceſſarily one in him who is raiſed from the dead in the Glory of the Father, and who ſaw no corruption, as if his having fleſh and bones ſhould render him a fleſhly man or body; but that they are vainly puft up with their fleſhly mind, not holding the head, &amp;c. Yea</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither is his body a fleſhly body, nor any where by us or the Scripture ſo called, for though ſometime (as we ſhewed) it was ſubject to the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the fleſh that are natural to us from fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo in ſome ſence might be ſaid to be a natural body, though he was therein made that which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was not, and that in a ſupernatural way (as aforeſaid) and was therein as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes perfectly without ſin, yet taking part with us of fleſh and blood, that he might dye our death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before is hinted, yet now being raiſed from the dead, even that body of his fleſh which God hath raiſed up from the dead is now in Heaven with the Father, a ſpiritual, heavenly and glorious body, ſo as yet the bodies of any of his members on earth are not; But their bodies alſo that now are vile, and ſee corruption as his never did, even the ſame that are now living on the earth or ſleeping in the duſt, ſhall be raiſed by him in the firſt Reſurrection at his appearing, not carnal bodies or vile and corruptible as now they are, but faſhioned into the likeneſs of his glorious body, when this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To the firſt part, VVhether the ſame Chriſt, &amp;c. be not made a quickening Spirit, <hi>We anſwer,</hi> Yea he is, or rather (to uſe the expreſſion of the Scripture) he was ſo made, for he is not now making or to be made ſo.</p>
                  <p>And further we ſay, We truly believe and propofeſs without hidden things of diſhoneſty, That it is the ſame Chriſt who in the dayes of his fleſh ſuffered, &amp;c. Now that was the word made fleſh, and ſo Chriſt of the fruit of <hi>Davids</hi> Loyns after the fleſh, who had both Spirit and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and if he were without either now he could not be the Chriſt, much leſſe the ſame Chriſt, yea the Scripture quoted by them, 1 Cor. 15. 45. ſaith, <hi>That as it was the firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>that was made a living Soul, ſo it is the ſecond Adam that was made a quickening Spirit.</hi> And therefore as the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> being made a living Soul, hindred not his having a natural body, yea it was the man that was made ſo; ſo neither doth the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> being made a quickening Spirit, hinder his having a Spiritual and Glorious Body that yet hath fleſh and bones, yea its the man Chriſt Jeſus the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt, of the fruit of <hi>Davids</hi> loyns after the fleſh, that was made both Lord and Chriſt, and ſo a quickening Spirit; It is the ſame Jeſus that ſuffered, &amp; ſo in the ſame body in which he once (not onely ſuffered, but) ſuffered for our ſins and bore them on the Tree, the juſt for the unjuſt, &amp;c. (which alſo is more then they include in their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his Sufferings) it is this Jeſus who was both dead and buried, whom God hath raiſed up and made both Lord and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>They would ſeem to grant that the ſame Chriſt who in the dayes of his fleſh ſuffered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is made a quickening ſpirit, yet privily deny it, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe not Jeſus to be the ſame and very Chriſt that was ſo made, which they do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110170:60"/>
not while they acknowledge him not to be ſo made in the ſame body of his fleſh in which he once ſo ſuffered; For the Name Jeſus alwayes ſignifies Chriſt as come in the fleſh, and ſo takes in that body of his fleſh, upon the taking where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Name was given him (as is before noted) yea he whom God hath raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dead, and made both Lord and Chriſt, and ſo a quickening ſpirit, is ſaid to be Chriſt of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> after the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The laſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (as alſo before is hinted) in not confeſſing which they privily deny what they pretend to grant, and their ſeeming grant is like <hi>John VVhiteheads</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reſurrection of Chriſt, who at our meeting with him at <hi>Gedney,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to believe that the ſame Chriſt that took fleſh in a body prepared for him of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and in that body ſerved and ſuffered for at a time, that the ſame Chriſt was raiſed and glorified with the Fathers own ſelf; And yet then would by no means acknowledge (though oft intreated and urged to ſpeak plainly to the Queſtion) that he was raiſed and did live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and continue for ever in the ſame body in which he ſo ſerved and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or that the ſame body that then once in the laſt ages ſuffered and was hung on the Tree, was raiſed again from the dead, and is now alive for evermore; yea at laſt he deneyed that the ſame dead bodies of men that dye in <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be raiſed and made alive again from the dead, that even the ſame that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall come forth of their Graves by Chriſt, and ſo conſequently that Chriſt is raiſed; for if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed, for Jeſus Chriſt was dead and buried, as before we have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>So then their immagination or meaning in this equivocal grant appears to be this, That the ſame Chriſt that had a body diſtinct from all other, in which in the dayes of his fleſh he ſuffered, is now raiſed, aſcended, and gone out of that body of his fleſh into ſome (imaginary) ſpiritual being, which in that body of his fleſh he could not be made, yet that in that his ſpiritual being, he is in the bodies or bodies and ſouls of divers perſons, working, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuffering the ſame things in them which were typically or as a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſuffered and done in that body of his fleſh, and ſo they neither confeſs him already come in the fleſh, or as having finiſhed that his coming in the fleſh, or firſt appearing, to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, and ſo the works the Father gave him to do on the earth, in that his once ſuffering for ſin; nor do they confeſſe, yea they deny Jeſus to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſt who is made a quickening ſpirit, and therefore we have laid down our anſwer plainly and diſtinctly, that its not onely the ſame that had a body and therein once ſuffered, but alſo that its he in the ſame body of his fleſh in which he once ſuffered for ſins, even the ſame Jeſus whom they crucified, ſlew and hung on a Tree, that God hath made the Lord and Chriſt, and ſo a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening ſpirit, and have explained and confirmed our anſwer in the expreſſions of the Scripture quoted by them, that its the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c. (of which they take no notice) for that fully ſhews the fulneſſe and ungodlineſſe of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, which therefore we again deſire the Reader to mind, <hi>viz.</hi> that that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. ſpeaks of two <hi>Adams,</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> the laſt <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo then they were both men, and had each the perſonal body of a man, when

                  <p>It was the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> that was made a living Soul, and ſo it is the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſecond man that was made a quickening ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The Lord formed the body of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> of the duſt of the earth, and then breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. and man became a living Soul; the breath of Life did not annihilate the body formed of the duſt, but enlive and quicken it, by poſſeſſing it and defuſing it ſelf in and through all the parts and members of it, ſo that that breath of Life and the body of the man united, the man became a Living Soul; it is not ſaid it, or the breath of life became ſo, but the man, upon Gods breathing in that breath of life, he, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> became a living Soul; And had he abode in that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe and innocency in which he was made, he might have lived for ever; but as there was then none dead for him to quicken, ſo neither was he fitted for ſuch a work, ſo that when he (this firſt man <hi>Adam</hi>) not keeping his firſt eſtate, but ſeeking out inventions, ſinned and fell from God under the Sentence of and into a ſtate of death and Separation from God, and ſo death paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men, and they are all partakers of fleſh and blood, foraſmuch as all have ſinned in that offence of one, they muſt all have been ſhut out and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for ever in that loſſe and miſery, if God had not found out and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a ſecond man <hi>Adam</hi> and made him a quickening Spirit; for as by man came death, ſo by man alſo the aboliſhing of and reſurrection from the dead, ſuch was mans condition by reaſon of ſin entered and overſpreading the nature, and death already paſſed on him in the Sentence of God, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another man, a ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in whom Gods Truth might be fulfilled and his Juſtice ſatisfied in the puniſhment of ſin &amp; death of the ſinner, and through whoſe Sufferings by his overcoming death, the Righteouſneſſe of God might appear and ſhine forth therein, we could not have been quickened or made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; Therefore for the recovery of fallen man, that he might not be utterly expelled or ſhut out in the firſt death and baniſhment, but ſuch Redemption wrought and obtained for him, that through the Redeemer he might be ſaved, and that they might be all in due time made alive or raiſed from the firſt death, to appear before the judgement Seat of their Redeemer, therefore God found out and prepared a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and made him a quickening ſpirit. Now this ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was even his onely begotten Son, the Word that was in the beginning with God, and ſo before the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and he by whom and for whom the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and all things were made that were made, the proper Lord and Heir of all things, for he onely was able and meet to undertake ſuch a work, and to have help laid upon him for us, but he was made fleſh of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſo made man, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in the fulneſſe of time once in the end of the World, and that by a wonderful work of new Creation, by the Grace, Gift and Appointment of the Father, and by the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt (as is foreſhewed) and ſo was the Lord from Heaven, Heavenly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he was made fleſh in that body ſo prepared for him, yet very Man made of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> after the fleſh, and therein partaker with us of fleſh and blood, and ſo like to natural &amp; fallen ſinful men, from birth to death in all

things except ſin; This ſecond man, the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe he ſo humbled himſelf in that body prepared for him, to that purpoſe God hath raiſed from the dead and exalted with his Right hand, and Glorified him with his own ſelf, in that body in which he bore our ſins with the Glory he had with him, as his onely begotten Son before the World was, and therein actually made him in a full and Glorious ſence a quickning Spirit, to quicken and raiſe others, as is fore-ſhew'n; So that his being made a quickning Spirit, no more Annihilates his riſen and Glorified body, having fleſh and bones, from being truly a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Spiritual, and perſonal body, then the Breath of Life did Annihilate the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> body; yea without that body he is not the man Jeſus Chriſt, us he is affirmed to be that was ſo made, whereas if he were onely a Spirit, without the body of a man, the aſſertion muſt have been contrariwiſe thus; He that was the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> is now the quickening Spirit, and not <hi>Adam;</hi> But the Text ſerves not theſe mens turn, for it ſaith,</p>

                  <p>Theſe men therefore are of no Judgement concerning the Faith, foraſmuch as that which our Saviour gives as the Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why his fleſh is meat indeed, and his Blood drink indeed, namely that God would give him Glory as the fruit of it; they imply at leaſt as a thing rendering it more hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, yea ſecretly they imply it as a reaſon againſt the underſtanding Chriſts fleſh, and Chriſts blood (that is meat indeed and drink indeed) according to the plain import of his words</p>
                  <p>And ſo in this implication they ſignifie, not onely (as we have noted of them upon the firſt part of this queſtion) that in his being made a quickning Spirit, they fancy a nullifying of the real being of that Body of his fleſh in which they grant he once ſuffered, but alſo that by his fleſh and his blood which is meat and drink indeed, they mean not that fleſh once given for the life of the World, nor that blood once ſhed for the Remiſſion of ſins, or his once ſuffering in the fleſh, to the ſheding of his blood, as alſo more plainly appears in their next queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their ſenſuality, not having the Spirit, appeares (at leaſt if we conſider their ſence of its being nigh,) in their ſaying, that the fleſh and blood of Chriſt is ſo nigh to every true beliver, that his fleſh is his meat indeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which they imply, that it cannot be meat to them, and ſo not fed upon by them, except nigh to them, and explain not themſelves in what ſence they mean nigh, which had been very needfull in ſuch a caſe, when they lay ſo much ſtreſs upon its being nigh, eſpecially ſeeing the expreſſions are not found in the Scripture, that the fleſh and blood of Chriſt is nigh to every true believer, much leſs, that its being nigh is the cauſe of its being meat and drink unto them,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:62"/>
the Scripture ſaith that the word of Faith which the Apoſtles preached, the Preaching of the Croſſe, declaring Chriſt to be riſen from the dead, was made nigh to them in and through the Preaching of it, even ſo in their mouth and and in their heart, that it might be believed and confeſſed by them, but he ſaith not that the fleſh and blood of Chriſt was nigh to every true believer, yea doubtleſſe, even that fleſh and blood of Chriſt vertually, of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks, was meat and drink indeed Spiritually and by Faith to <hi>Abraham</hi> and other true believers in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets times, and yet they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the promiſes in which they were actually brought forth and manifeſted, but ſaw them afar off and rejoyced in them; We ſay therefore, ſeeing the expreſſions are not found in the Scripture, there was the more need for them to have explained in what ſence they mean, that it is ſo nigh them, which though they do not, yet the whole queſtion compared with the former, (yea the following Queſtion more clearly) ſhewes their meaning to be, that except the fleſh and blood of Chriſt be nigh them, as to time and place, in a preſent ſencible being, it cannot be meat &amp; drink indeed to them; By which it appears, that that which they mean by the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, which is meat and drink to the believer, it is ſomething alwayes in a preſent &amp; ſencible being nigh to, with, and in them, in which they ſhew themſelves ſenſual, not having the Spirit, living by ſence and not by Faith, which is the evidence of things not ſeen, as alſo the ground or confidence of things hoped for.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall here therefore for the help of others, and that none may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled with inticing words, poſitively aſſert, and ſhew by the Scriptures,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is meant by Chriſts Fleſh, and Chriſts Blood, that is meat and drink indeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How or wherein that was actually ſo made, and from what reaſon it is evidenced to be ſuch meat and drink indeed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How and by what means it is brought to us, that it may be fed on by us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

Whence alſo both the eating and drinking in the Supper of the Lord is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be done in remembrance of him. Now remembrance implyes ſomething actually done, finiſhed and paſſed through in and by him (as he is the object of remembrance) which is therefore alwayes to be remembred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its infinite and abiding vertue, and uſefulneſſe, (he being by means thereof made both Lord and Chriſt) and ſo that which is remembred, and
<pb facs="tcp:110170:62"/>
ſhewed forth, is the Lords death, the whole abaſement, humiliation, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ſuſtained and finiſhed by him in that body of his fleſh, the Croſſe of Chriſt, with the glorious ends, vertues, and preciouſneſſe thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26.

                  <p>Yet in the diſtinct mention of his fleſh and his blood, there is ſome diſtinct conſiderations of him, and him crucified, or of the Croſſe of Chriſt (as he is ſo, and by means thereof the Bread of God) ſignified to us; And that both in his Humiliation and ſufferings, and in the ends of them, and their powerful effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy with the Father to thoſe ends for us.</p>

                  <p>He was bruiſed, wounded, and put to death in the body of his fleſh for our tranſgreſſions, that through death he might aboliſh death in his Reſurrection, and make ſuch peace and healing for us, that through him we might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and ſaved, that were all our life time through fear of death ſubject to bondage; Yea therefore, alſo he ſhed his blood and powered out his Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, that he might by vertue thereof obtaine and receive into himſelf a better even Eternal life for us, with all ſuch gifts for men, yea for the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious alſo, as was needful, that yet while it is to day they might be brought back to God, and that he might be able to ſave to the utmoſt them that come to God by him.</p>

This his fleſh and his blood was evidenced to be meat indeed, and drink indeed for men ſpiritually to feed upon, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, and his offering up his ſpotleſſe body a Ranſom or price of Redemption once for all, as being made perfect through ſufferings, and his being accepted, and ſet down on the Right hand of God, and Glorified with the Fathers own ſelf, Immeaſurebly filled with all gifts in the man for men, (as before we have ſhewed) all as the fruit of his precious blood, ſufferings and death; Yea therein was he, and ſo his paſt and finiſhed, ſufferings actually and fully made, and mightily declared to be ſuch bread of Life; For if he had not roſe and revived or lived again in the ſame body in which he bore our ſins, to offer himſelf to God in Heaven it ſelf, and there to appear in his preſence for us, his fleſh could have profited us nothing, but now its profitable to all things; If he had been ſtill and often ſuffering for ſins, or could die, or ſhed blood any more, then had there been no ſuch vertue in that which he hath already done, if therein he had not finiſhed the works of abaſement, and blood-ſhedding the Father gave him to do on the Earth, and thereby obtained the Reſurrection, and Glory of Eternal Redemption, and Life in himſelf for us, we had been yet in our ſins, and the Preaching of his Croſſe and Faith therein had been vain, which is not in blood now ſhedding, but ſhed, the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Death finiſhed and paſt, as to the acting, or actuall bearing or ſuſtaining them, but God hath raiſed him from the dead, and given him Glory,

                  <p n="3">3. This is brought to us, that it may be Spiritually fed on by us, not in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial or ſencible being of that fleſh and blood in us, or ſencibly nigh to us, nor in a dayly coming in the fleſh, and ſo ſuffering for ſin, and offering himſelf often, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within us, or without &amp; before us, that we might be eye witneſſes of theſe things, as thoſe that lived in the dayes of his fleſh, or being manifeſted in the fleſh were; For then muſt he often have ſuffered from the foundation of the World, but now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, he once ſuffered and died for ſin, and can die no more, either in his own Perſon, or for ſin, and for the putting away ſin in any other perſon; But that which he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done and compleated in himſelf by means thereof is brought to us by the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit in the Goſpel, and other witneſſes of his goodneſſe and Name given us, in which he that was dead is witneſſed by means thereof to be alive for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>more, and appearing in the preſence of God for us; Therefore its ſaid, that he gave himſelf a Ranſom once for all, not that he ſhould offer himſelf often, or any more, but to be teſtified in due time in what he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, and is become thereby, or that he ſhould now be a Teſtimonie thereof to men, and of the Grace and Glory of the Father therein, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They have hitherto intimated their corrupt minde againſt the perſonall and now Glorious body of Chriſt, and againſt the heavens in which it is, as onely deſigning to caſt him down from his Excellency; now they proceed to imply, and privily caſt out their venom againſt the blood of Chriſt, as if that blood that was ſhed, is perſonal ſufferings to the ſheding of his blood, and death of the Croſs, were not the drink indeed, and purger of the conſcience, for ſo in their ſuppoſition, they imply that as a queſtion, whether that blood of Chriſt that was ſhed be the drink indeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then frame their following queſtion of purpoſe to deny, or make it void from being ſo, for if it be ſo (ſay they) then where is it, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> In which as in the former they imply, that men cannot eat his fleſh, and drink his blood, except it be in a ſencible being preſent with them, nigh to, or in them, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly deny that blood of his Croſs that was ſhed for the Remiſſion of ſins to be the drink indeed and the purger of the conſcience, becauſe it is not now ſhedding, and ſo as much deny his fleſh that was broken, and the preparing and giving it to be bruiſed, wounded, and broken for our tranſgreſſions, to be meat indeed, becauſe thoſe works and ſufferings therein are finiſhed and paſt, and not doing, or to be done over again in that perſon, or any other, and ſo cannot be in a preſent or ſencible being nigh to, in or with any man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſtill to caſt reproach upon it, further imply, that if that blood that was ſhed be the drink indeed, and ſo conſequently, if that body of his fleſh be meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, then the eating or drinking muſt be in a natural or ſenſual manner, like as natural meat and drink is eaten and drunk; For this they fully ſignifie, the blood that was ſhed cannot be drunk except in its material being, it be in Chriſts fleſh, or ſomewhere elſe nigh to men in a preſent material exiſtence; For if that blood
<pb facs="tcp:110170:65"/>
that was ſhed (ſay they) be the drink indeed, then where is it, if not in Chriſts fleſh, as they ſay we affirmed, but they ſay falſly, for we oft declared, that as the Blood of Chriſt is the bottom, ground or foundation of our Faith, or that by means of which he is ſo, and ſo as it is the drink indeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even ſo it is in Heaven with the Father, even in Chriſts perſonal Glorious Body; But that is not in a material and mortal exiſtence or being of it in his fleſh, and with it as here he was partakers of Fleſh and Blood, but in the infinite vertue and preciouſneſs of its being ſhed, and ſo his ſufferings once ſuffered in the fleſh, are for ever accepted and remembered with the Father, and his Body Glorified, and immeaſurably fil'd with the Eternal Spirit, yea he therein made a quickening Spirit for and to us, and all by means of his death, the vertue and preciouſneſſe of which remains for ever, and ſo the Fruit of it and grace in and through it, which alſo as we hinted before, may be called his Blood, as being the Fruit of it, and things procured and purchaſed by it; But then alſo in this their reproach,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which they add as a Reaſon why Chriſts Blood that was ſhed muſt be in his fleſh, if it be the drink indeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Namely that men muſt drink it, ſhewes their folly, for the neceſſity of drinking his Blood can be no Argument, that his Blood is in his fleſh as before it was ſhed, for as ſo it was in a materiall being in his fleſh and mixed with it, it cannot be drunk in a ſenſuall or naturall way of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they would ſignifie it muſt, if that be the drink indeed, it is rather to be drunk as ſhed and powered out for us; We read of eating fleſh with the Blood in it, a thing forbidden in the Law, but of drinking Blood in the fleſh, we read not, but in their nonſencical language. Yea,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the whole of this queſtion, they imply an immagination that there is ſome other Blood of Chriſt beſides that which was ſhed, or his Blood ſhedding and death once ſuffered in the fleſh, and that that other Blood is the drink indeed, and the purger of the conſcience, and ſo conſequently that there is ſome other fleſh, or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his fleſh beſides that which was broken for us, which, and not the former, is the meat indeed; And ſo they in their immagination make void his once ſuffering in the fleſh, in that one body ſo prepared for him, (as before) as of no abiding vertue or efficacy with the Father for the taking away our ſins, and ſo for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual feeding of the believer now, to this they render the Croſſe of Chriſt of no effect, that they may lift up ſomething elſe in the name and place of it; For fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer therefore to this Queſtion, and for the help of others, we here add to what former demonſtrations we have given of the fleſh of Chriſt that is meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and of his Blood that is drink indeed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is no other fleſh of Chriſt that is meat indeed, but that one Body of his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that was prepared, given and broken for us, even his <hi>Fleſh</hi> that he gave for the Life of the World, nor any other Blood of Chriſt that is drink indeed, but that Blood or death of the Croſs, that ſhedding of his Blood, and powering out his Soul unto death, which he once ſuffered in that his own Body for our ſins, (without which we could have had no remiſſion of them) that he obtaining by it plenteous Redemption even the forgiveneſſe of ſins, might therein alſo ſeal and confirm the new Teſtament of precious promiſes, and become himſelf in the man the Mediator of it, and ſo an high Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck.</hi> It is onely his being made fleſh in that one Body prepared for him, and his works and ſufferings finiſhed in that his own body, in which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb facs="tcp:110170:65"/>
once in the end of the World to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, which the Father hath found out and accepted as a ranſom or price of Redemption for ſinful and fallen mankind, and by means of which he hath given him glory in that his own Body in which he ſo Suffered, that our Faith and Hope might be in God, and therefore alſo it is onely that Croſs of Chriſt, becauſe of the infinite grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in teſtified, which is commended and ſhed abroad by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in his evidencing it as already paſt, as to the actual enduring and ſuffering it, in that in due time Chriſt dyed for the ungodly, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. 10. and becauſe of the Infinite vertue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs thereof for our help, which is ſhewed in the diſcovery of him, as now raiſed from the dead in the ſame body in which he Suffered thoſe things, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by means of that his death, the prOpitiation for our ſins, and our advocate with the Father, &amp;c. (as before) in which all True Believers have the ground of their peace rejoycing and hope, and ſo in Chriſt Jeſus, all other rejoycings are fleſhly and after the ſenſual mind, whence the Apoſtle determined not to know any thing among believers, but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified (not crucifying or often Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the foundation of the world) yea God forbid that we ſhould rejoyce in any thing ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, for the Preaching of that is to them that periſh fooliſhneſs, but to us that are ſaved the Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. 24. and 2. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That ſuch things as are done and paſt as to the actual accompliſhment of them long before Men had their particular beings in the world, yet may be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fed on by thoſe Men and ſo eaten and drunk in a like ſence, as in which the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt is ſaid to be eaten and drunk, though not remaining in a preſent or ſencible being to them, or otherwiſe then in the virtue and fruit of then; this might be ſhewed in other things mentioned in the Scripture as Types and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of this, as the Lords paſſing over the houſes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when he ſmote the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> was to be remembred and rejoyced in throughout their Generations, and therefore that day to be kept for a memorial, a feaſt to the Lord by an ordinance for ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 12 14 27. So we alſo are inſtructed to keep the feaſt of rejoycing in Chriſt in thankful commemmoration of what he hath done, for ſaith the Text, <hi>Chriſt our Paſsover is ſacrificed</hi> (not ſacrificing or daily and often offering himſelf, but this he did once, that is the ground of our rejoycing in him evermore, he is ſacrificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8.)</p>
                  <p>Again Gods dividing the Sea by his ſtrength, and breaking the heads of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons in the waters, and ſo the broken heads of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> even <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt as broken and deſtroyed in the Red Sea, was given for meat to the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 13, 14. though yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt was not in a preſent ſenſible being, near that people all the time they were meat for them, nor yet their drowning or deſtruction actually done in their ſight or before them all along but once finiſhed, and therefore ſo worthy to be remembred, and ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of feeding and rejoycing to them in after ages, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 5. 10. and 78. and 105. and 106. but it is ſo clear in this which is the Truth and fulneſſe of all thoſe Types and Patterns, namely the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt and the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, and ſo evident in what is already ſaid of it, that more need not be ſaid to ſhew and prove that that <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt, even the words being made fleſh in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinful fleſh; and ſo his whole abaſement and ſufferings in the fleſh,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:66"/>
the dayes of which are paſt, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. and ſo his blood, his ſufferings even to blood, to death in the fleſh, which as to the actual accompliſhment and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is now paſt and finiſhed, yea therefore becauſe his ſufferings and death is ſo finiſhed, that he is in the virtue and bye means thereof raiſed and glorified in the ſame body for us (as is before ſhewed) ſo that he can die no more; therefore is his fleſh meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed, the Lords Death worthy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be remembred and rejoyced in himſelf in the Infinite Grace of it, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Virtue and Fruit of it, that Bread of God, the Bread of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
                  <p>But for a little further demonſtration how ſuch a thing may be and is, that even his perſonal Sufferings and Abaſement in the fleſh, and ſo the Lords death may be eaten and drunk; now ſo long after the actual accompliſhment and ſuſtaining of it is paſt, as alſo that it might be ſo before its manifeſtation or coming forth into actual and ſenſible being, for he did not often Suffer for ſin from the Foundation of the world but once in the end of the world, as <hi>Heb. 9. 26. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>For ſome further demonſtration of this, we ſay, We ſhall here add a word or two to ſhew what the eating his fleſh and drinking his blood is, or how and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it may be eaten and drunk; and ſo, how the Blood of Chriſt purgeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>The eating and drinking here is not naturally or bodily with the mouth, but mentally with the Mind, Spirit or inner man, and that not in or by a ſenſual imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination or apprehenſion of ſeeing, feeling or proving the works, Sufferings or things that are the bottom, matter of feeding and rejoycing to the heart, as acted in them or in the preſent time before them, but it is by faith, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 16, 17. yea the eating and drinking is an act and exerciſe of faith, as oppoſed to ſight or ſence, <hi>we walk</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) (<hi>and ſo the Juſt ſhall live, Rom. 1. 17. Heb. 10. 38) by faith,</hi> not by ſight, and ſo the life that I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me, and gave himſelf (note that he ſaith not is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giveth, but gave himſelf) for me, the love that was manifeſted in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable gift and perfect offering of himſelf already prepared and perfected, and ſo thoſe works already finiſhed on the earth, through which that love is ſtill mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and commended, are mentioned as the bottom, ground of his faith, and ſo matter of his feeding, ſo that though the Apoſtles had ſeen the Lord, yet they did not now live by that ſight, but by faith as oppoſed to ſight, <hi>yea bleſſed are thoſe that have not ſo ſeen and yet believed,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour.) And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That even thoſe that were partakers of like precious faith with them, yet had not ſo ſeen him as they had done, but did believe and rejoyce in him</hi> (though now they ſee him not) <hi>John 20. 29. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8. and it is in ſuch believing on him as the Scripture hath ſaid, that himſelf and him crucified, and ſo his fleſh and his blood is eaten and drunk, as may be ſeen in <hi>John</hi> 6. 35. with chap. 7. 37, 38, 39.</p>
                  <p>A man believing in and with the heart, the record that God hath given of Chriſt, that is, receiving withal acceptation, loving and cloſing with it (according to the underſtanding given him) as a good and faithful ſaying, letting it dwell in him, and ſo having his heart exerciſed in it and by it, to conſider him and ſtay on his Name as therein ſet forth, ſeeking Satisfaction, Reſt, Righteouſneſſe and Strength in him, in ſuch believing, mindfulneſſe and dependance on him, and ſo believing
<pb facs="tcp:110170:66"/>
on him as the Scripture hath ſaid, he is therein ſaid to Eat him and Drink him, or the Bread and Drink he giveth, becauſe therein the heart and mind is ſo ſtayed in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 5 and exerciſed with delight and well-pleaſedneſſe about him, and the things of him as to a taſting how Gracious the Lord is, and proving the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fitneſs and excellency of him in and according to the knowledge of him, ſo <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy words were found and I did eat them,</hi> Jer. 15. 16. and becauſe alſo in ſuch ſpiritual eating, a man certainly comes to taſte, prove and meet with ſuch peace refreſhing, joy, ſtrength and bleſſedneſs (in the firſt fruits of the Spirit) as anſwers to the inſtruction and ground therein ſet before him (as alſo follows in that of <hi>Jeremy, thy word was to me the joy and the rejoycing of mine heart, as David</hi> alſo profeſſeth, <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taste, yea ſweeter than Honey to my mouth, Pſal.</hi> 119. 103) for the Word of God works effectually in them that believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as ſuch, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. unto them therefore that believe Chriſt is precious, for ſo Chriſt comes to dwell in their heart, in or by the Faith of him, in what he hath done and is become for us, and in the hope ſet before us in him, yea he himſelf as ſo known &amp; believed by them is in their hearts by faith, the hope of Glory, the ground of it in what he hath done, and the thing hoped for, in what is further to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and done by him.</p>
                  <p>Now faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, as well as the confidence of things hoped for, by it our fathers ſaw and rejoyced in the promiſes of the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow when both were yet afar off to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. And we have much more advantage to behold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him, the works being finiſhed which the Father gave him to do upon the earth, and now the word of faith manifeſted, the Preaching fully made known with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven, yea therefore becauſe the works are now actually finiſhed (as vertually they were from the foundation of the world) becauſe God hath raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification, therefore being Juſtified, by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alſo hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now received the atonement (as already made by his blood) we have acceſs by faith into this Grace in which we ſtand and rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God, and not onely ſo, but we glory in tribulations alſo, proving a bleſſed fruit of them, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt which is given us in this Preaching of the Croſs, that when we were yet without ſtrength in due time Chriſt dyed for the ungodly, &amp;c. ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 22. 24, 25. with chap. 5. 1. 11. And ſo the eating his fleſh and drinking his blood, as we are now inſtructed to it, ſince the works were finiſhed in the Perſon of Chriſt which the Father gave him to do on the earth, is ſignified to be in a believing mindfulneſſe and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Lords death as already actually finiſhed and paſt, and ſo of him in what he hath therein and thereby compleated in himſelf for us, therein conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the infinite and abiding vertue and preciouſneſſe of that blood or death of his Croſs, as mightily declared in his being raiſed and glorified in that body, by means thereof, and as brought to us in the preaching of that his Croſs, with the evidence and demonſtration of the ſpirit and power, and ſo in ſeeking reſt, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſtrength and rejoycing in him, in and by ſuch believing in him; So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Blood of Chriſt purgeth the Conſcience through Faith in that his Blood, Blood ſhed or death, and not by ſhedding blood again, or by doing or

                  <p>Nor was this coming of his ever ſo ſeen, nor but by Faith of any before thoſe times, no though it hath been deſired by many of them, <hi>Mat. 13. 16, 17. Luk.</hi> 10. 23, 24.

Calling it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Reſurrection of the dead, yea when he ſpeaks of it, as denyed by ſome among them, he ſaith not ſimply, how ſay ſome among you, there is no Reſurrection, but how do they ſay there is no Reſurrection of the dead?

And its not the Spirit or Soul of the man diſtinct that dies in the death ſpoken of, or ceaſes to be in a ſencible being, much leſs the new man, or mind, and Spirit of Chriſt received by and in the believer, but its the natural body that dies, and being dead is ſown in the Earth, which is that of which theſe would inſinuate by theſe queries, that there is no Reſurrection af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the natural or bodily death; And to that purpoſe here ſignifie this as their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſeeds that muſt have in the Reſurrection every one his own body, are not natural, but Spiritual; For further anſwer therefore to their Query, and for evincing the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the dead, and manifeſting the folly of their ſubtilty in this queſtion, and the following, we ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This queſtion is fooliſh and unlearned, for no Scripture ſpeaks of ſeeds that muſt have every one their own body in the Reſurrection; But the Apoſtle tells us of ſeeds that men ſow, expreſly of Wheat, or other Grain, to which God gives a body as pleaſes him, and to every ſeed its own body, and they are natural ſeeds.</p>
                  <p>Again they wreſt the Metaphor, and Compariſon, confounding it with the thing to be ſet forth by it, not regarding or being willingly Ignorant, that Metaphors and Compariſons hold not in every thing, but in ſuch things onely as ſerve to ſet forth in ſome reſemblance the thing for which they are uſed, and its no wrong to anſwer them in this query according to their folly, as 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 36. &amp;c.</hi> Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt (mark, thou ſoweſt as differing it from bodies ſown by God, in his changing them by Death) is not quickened except it die, nor ſaith he that the ſame it, or ſeed is not quickened after it dies, but it is not quickened before, or except it die; And that which thou ſoweſt, thou (he ſaith not God, but ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the Metaphor, Thou) ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of ſome other grain, (theſe and ſuch are the ſeeds ſpoken of, of which he ſaith) but God (he ſaith not thou) giveth it a body as it pleaſeth him,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:76"/>
and to every ſeed his own body, ſo then tis the ſame it which men ſowe a bare grain, to which God giveth a body for Glory, Beauty and Fruitfulneſſe as it pleaſeth him; And had they underſtood the ſimilitude and the end and uſe of it here, it might have preſerved them from denying the Reſurrection, and living again (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the natural and bodily death) of the ſame body that died or dies, either of the perſon of Chriſt or of the perſons of men, that ſhall by him be raiſed from the dead, for it is uſed as a reſemblance of both, as appeares by comparing it with <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. 23. Where Chriſt is riſen from the dead, in the vertue and for the worth of his own righteouſneſſe, in laying down his Life for us, that he might take it again, is mentioned as the firſt fruits of them that ſlept, the firſt born from the dead (as alſo, <hi>Col. 1. 18. Acts</hi> 26. 23.) And then the reſt that die in <hi>Adam</hi> are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as afterward to be raiſed by him in their own order at his coming, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Now this ſimilitude follows as a reſemblance of the reſurrection both of him and them, and in anſwer to a ſenſual queſtion, or cavil (like this of theirs) which he ſuppoſes ſome ignorant and fooliſh men might make, how are the dead raiſed up, and with what body do they come? And therefore he propounds the queſtion &amp; gives the anſwer in terms of the preſent time rather then of the time paſt, or to come, becauſe he includes both the reſurrection of Chriſt who was already raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the reſurrection of all men that now die in <hi>Adam</hi> which is yet to come, both being well included and expreſſed under ſuch termes, how are the dead raiſed, &amp; with what body do they come? That is, how is it both in that which is perfected in him, and ſhall be afterward perfected by him, as <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and therefore alſo he ſtill ſpeaks in ſuch phraſe or manner of ſpeaking in the preſent tenſe in the ſimilitude, and further anſwer following.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we ſhall finde our Saviour ſometimes uſing the ſame Metaphor in a like ſimilitude, to reſemble the neceſſity, vertue and preciouſneſſe of his own death for us, and the power and fruitfulneſſe of his Reſurrection by means thereof, as in <hi>John</hi> 12. 24. Where after he hath told them, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. that the hour is come, that the Son of man ſhould be Glorified, namely (as appeares in what follows) in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the judgement of this World, and on the finiſhing of that, in being raiſed and Glorified (in that body) with the Fathers own ſelf, (compare <hi>ver.</hi> 23. with <hi>ver.</hi> 24. 27. 31, 32. and Chap. 13. 31, 32. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9, 10.) He then adds, <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, verily I ſay unto you, except a corn of Wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die it bringeth forth much Fruit;</hi> its evident by what is before noted, that our Saviour there in the compariſon points at himſelf, and his own death and reſurrection. He onely is that man that without his abaſement and death, might have abode alone without us, in his own Excellence and Glory, but then he could not have redeemed mankind, nor have brought many Sons to Glory; now as the corn of Wheat that dieth riſeth up after in its ſtalk to many corns, ſo he dying one for all, is ſo likewiſe quickened, or raiſed from the dead for or in the behalf of them all, that he is the reſurrection and the Life for them, and they ſhall all be made alive from the firſt death by him, ſome to Eternal Life, others to eternal Damnation; The Wheat, they that have done good, ſhall be gathered into his Garner; the chaffe, they that have done evil ſhall be burnt with unquenchable fire, and all by him, and as the fruit of his once dying for them, who therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, roſe and revived that he might be Lord of all, the Judge of quick and dead, not
<pb facs="tcp:110170:77"/>
ſo any other man, or men, and ſo he moſtfully anſwers the ſimilitude or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon as uſed in that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 36, 37. alſo.</p>
                  <p>But now Chriſt being riſen from the dead, is become the firſt fruits of them that ſleep, and the firſt fruits and harveſt muſt needs be both of one and the ſame kind, as to the thing to be raiſed, though the firſt fruits be more excellent and glorious in it ſelf, then the following; His reſurrection therefore being the reſurrection of the body, the reſurrection of others by him muſt needs be the reſurrection of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alſo, for ſince by man came death (and was not that alſo the death of the Body) by man alſo the reſurrection of the dead, (and is not that the body) for as in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.

We further ſay with the Apoſtle in his following anſwer, and application of the compariſon, the ſame body that is now a natural body, it, even the ſame that is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in the Reſurrection after Death, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption; it, the ſame it or body that is ſown in diſhonour (having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, Breath, Beauty, or Fitneſſe for Society) it is raiſed in honour; it, the ſame that is ſown in weakneſſe (ſo as it cannot help it ſelf but moulders to duſt) it is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in power (and ſo in Immortality;) <hi>It,</hi> the ſame <hi>It,</hi> or body that is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a Spiritual body; For there is a natural Body, and ſuch are all men firſt, and there is a Spiritual Body, and ſuch ſhall the ſame bodies be that were ſown natural Bodies in the reſurrection, the ſame ſhall be Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it is the ſame body in a new quality; And as it is abſurd and unreaſonable to immagine that that Body that ſuffers much even to death for the name of Chriſt, ſhall after death ceaſe for ever, and another Body that never ſo ſuffered, be raiſed and Glorified in ſtead thereof, or that the body that runs on in wickedneſſe, and is yeilded up to unrighteouſneſſe even to death, ſhall from thence ceaſe to be for ever, and another Body riſe that never ſo acted the ſin, nor was imployed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of it, and ſuffer the puniſhment for the former, for we muſt all appear before the righteous Judgement Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive in his Body the things in the fruit or reward of them done in his Body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad, for what a man ſoweth, that ſhall he the man reap, be not deceived, God is not mocked, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 10.

                  <p>So likewiſe it is as abſurd to think there can be a reſurrection of that which never died, or before it be dead; Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened except it die, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before, it is the dead that riſe in the Reſurrection, <hi>Luke 20, 37.

                  <p>They imply, that every ſeed muſt have a body of its own Nature, and ſo that if the mortal and dead Body riſe, it muſt riſe the ſame, or in the ſame Quality, or manner of being (for ſo much they include in its own nature) in which its ſown, namely Vile, Mortal, Weak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all which it clearly appeares, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo greatly err, even as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> of old, becauſe they know not the Scriptures, as likewiſe, neither the Power of God, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24 27.</p>

                  <p>So likewiſe in the Reſurrection of the dead (yea more fully and clearly, for ſuch reſemblances have not the lively Image of ſuch greater things to come as yet are ſhadowed or reſembled by them) the ſame Body of man that dyed and was buried is raiſed, and ſo every Soul ſhall have its own proper Body which it laid down or departed out of, but not in the ſame quality or manner of being (which is all one with the nature or kind of beings in theſe mens confuſions.)

                  <p>But becauſe in this laſt Queſtion eſpecially they manifeſt their horrible Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and infidelity about the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the dead and Eternal Judgement, and what Deriders and Scoffers of both they be, even againſt the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſertions of Scripture, as in the fifteenth Queſtion they are of Chriſts perſonal coming the ſecond time; and that we may further bear witneſſe to the Truth (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed and reproached by them) for the good of others, we ſhall here add ſomething further in return to this Queſtion; alſo noting the palpable wickedneſſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſcope of it, and the falſhood, and folly they are found in, in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of ſuch a wicked enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The intention and ſcope of it is to faſten an error upon the Doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, and their coming forth to an Eternal Judgement after death, <hi>viz.</hi> That if ſo, then the wicked muſt come out of hell again after ſentenced and ſent thither, and thereby to give a total overthrow to that doctrine of the reſurrection of the dead Bodies of men, and their coming forth to Eternal judgement after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and bodily death, and ſo to make God a lyar, even in thoſe his moſt plain and full manifeſtations of the Truth, by the Son himſelf, who having declared the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful efficacy of his voice (as now ſpeaking from heaven in the glorious Goſpel) for making thoſe dead in ſins and treſpaſſes to hear, and to the quickening and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in life thoſe that in hearing hear, and ſaid, that hour is coming and now is, <hi>John</hi> 5. 25. he biddeth them <hi>verſ. 28. not marvel at that, for the hour is coming,</hi>) he ſaith not as before and now is, but onely <hi>that it is coming,</hi> and in leaving out that clauſe <hi>and now is,</hi> having mentioned it in the former declaration, he fully implies that the hour here ſpoken of in the 28. verſ. now is not, but certainly cometh after the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned hour or time that was then begun, even when God ſhall ſend us Jeſus who before was preached to us, as <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 20. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 14. See the inſtruction to the living from the conſideration of the future ſtate of the dead by <hi>T. M.

                  <p>This is that which the ſcope of this queſtion is to deny, and ſo conſequently that Chriſt is riſen from the dead, for if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt riſen, and ſo in the denyal of this the Apoſtles whole Preaching is rendred vain, and faith in Chriſt as Preached by them vain alſo, yea they are therein proclamed falſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, becauſe they have teſtified of him, that he raiſed up Chriſt whom he

                  <p n="2">2. In their purſuit of this end, they make lies and miſtakes their deſence, that which they firſt ſuppoſe and take for granted, as that in which their chief ſtrength lies, is neither granted by us nor ſo expreſſed in the Scripture, but according to the import of it in their query very erroneous, <hi>viz.</hi> that judgement is come upon the wicked after death, now that by <hi>is come,</hi> they mean is now already come as ſoon as they are dead, and that by Judgement they mean, the whole of the judgement, is clear by their bringing it to diſprove and deride a coming forth again to any other or further judgement, and ſo its very falſe; for though judgement may come upon them in this life, and their death is a terrible Judgement, it proves ſo accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, through their miſimprovement of their time, becauſe it cuts them off from further ſpace of repentance, they being from thence ſealed up and reſerved as Priſoners in the Pit, to the judgement of the great day of Chriſt, yet neither is the one or the other, that great and Eternal judgement, unto which all the ungodly that continue ſuch till death are reſerved to be puniſhed, nor doth that ſeize on them till that day of judgement, whence it is alwayes truly called the wrath to come, and not that is already come upon any; and ſo much is plain in that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. to which they would ſeem to allude, eſpecially if compared with other Scriptures, ſee the text, as it is appointed to men once to die, he ſpeaks of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, and ſo of the whole kind, for all ſhall once dye, though ſome ſhall not ſleep in death, but ſuffere a ſudden change, in which both death and reſurrection ſhall be accompliſhed upon them in a moment. But after this the judgement, he ſaith not that then, or (as theſe) that after this the judgement is come, as if it were already come upon ſuch of them as are dead, or ſhould come upon any that die, before the reſt (at leaſt of their generation or ſort of men) have finiſhed their courſe as well as they; But after this the Judgement, even after this appointment of the whole kind once to die, is fulfilled on all generations, then will be the general, final and Eternal judgement; And though thoſe that now ſleep in Jeſus and have ſuffered with him, ſhall have their judgement come upon them, their Kingdom &amp; glory given them to poſſeſs, firſt before the reſt of the dead, yet that will not be till the time and ſtate of the Reſurrection of the juſt that have ſuffered with him, for they ſhall firſt riſe from the dead, neither will that be till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that great day of Chriſt, when the dayes of ſufferings and trouble to that generation will be ended; So that the judgement that properly ſo called, as diſtinguiſhed from other Judgements in this life, that are temporal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible, even the Eternal judgement that is after death, it is in the time and ſtate of the Reſurrection, for there ſhall be a General Reſurrection of both the juſt and unjuſt, in which they ſhall come forth to their judgement, and that ſhall be to both at the hour or day of Chriſt, even at his appearing, and his Kingdom, <hi>Acts 24. 15. John 5. 28, 29. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1. and ſo much alſo appears in that which follows, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. where after he hath ſaid as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgement, he adds as a remedy againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that otherwiſe might be unto men in that death or that judgement following; ſo Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin to ſalvation; now as his firſt appearing to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf anſwers to the firſt death and miſery, and
<pb facs="tcp:110170:79"/>
was effectual, that by Chriſt we ſhould be ſaved from periſhing in it, and that through him we might be ſaved, ſo his ſecond appearing without ſin to Salvation anſwers to the judgement after death, and is ſuch as by it all thoſe that now through his grace bringing ſalvation to all men in due time do look for him, ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him, even from the wrath to come, when it ſhall come forth in that judgement, ſo as they ſhall ſtand in the judgement even before the Son of man when he appears, and the ſecond death ſhall have no power on them, yea they ſhall then be ſaved to the utmoſt by that his appearing, yea he ſhall then appear to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in that judgement which implies his appearing the ſecond time to be firſt, and the judgement after death following upon it, at that his appearing and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to come upon men in the time and ſtate of the reſurrection as before is ſhewed, compare with the forementioned Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Again their folly is manifeſt in taking up a ſence of the Word Hell, from ſome common contradions without examination, as if in every place it ſignified that place and ſtate of torment in which the wicked are to be puniſhed for ever after the paſſing of the Eternal judgement upon them; whereas they might have known the word Hell is uſed in Scripture generally for that which is deep and low, obſcure and dark; And ſo</p>

Sometime for that place and ſtate of darkneſs and ſeparation from God into which the Spirits of ungodly ſinners that dy in their ſins are caſt and ſhut up from the time of their departing out of the body, unto the judgement of the great day; for when the body returns to its duſt, then the ſpirit returns to God who gave it, (<hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 3. 21. and 12. 7.) by him to be appointed to its proper place, by whom the Spirits of Believers, ſuch as die in the Lord, are received into Paradiſe, a place and ſtate of pleaſure and reſt in heaven under the altar, on which the perfect Sacrifice was offered, ſometimes called <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, tis ſuch as in which they are from the time of their departure out of the fleſh or body with the Lord made perfect, (ſo much as the Spirit without the body is capable) yet ſtill waiting for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Body and Glorious Kingdom promiſed; And ſo likewiſe by him the Spirits of the diſobedient, that perſiſted in the refuſal of him, till their ſin was finiſhed, are when they depart out of the body, at the death of the body driven away, ſhut cut from his preſence, ſhut up as priſoners in ſome place and ſtate of darkneſſe, where they are reſerved to the judgement of the great day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 32. <hi>Iſa</hi> 24. 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20. And this is called hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13. that hell that follows or goes along with the firſt death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8.

Mankind unto him, and the Keys of Hell and Death into his hand. But now by him, that Hell going with or pertaining to the firſt death, as in this laſt ſence is onely appointed for a priſon for all the ungodly, in which they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as in chains of darkneſſe to the judgement of the great day, where alſo they are fil'd with unſpeakable horror and torment in their ſpirit, in the remembrance and ſence of what they have loſt, and for what lying vanities, and what they muſt ſhortly and for ever ſuffer in ſoul and body together reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And out of this Hell there ſhall be ſuch a deliverance, as may be reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the deliverance of Priſoners to judgement, ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13. <hi>John.</hi> 8. 28, 29. in which yet they are not delivered out of darkneſſe, but ſtill in a ſtate of ſeparation from God, and the Light of his countenance brought forth to receive their bodies that ſlept in duſt, and in them to receive their final conviction and judgement.

                  <p n="4">4. Sometime (and but ſeldome the word Hell ſingly, but) Hell fire is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for that wrath to come, the lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, which is to man the ſecond death, into which they are not caſt while the body is held in the grave, and the ſpirit detained in priſon in the firſt Death, this is that unquenchable fire ever burning and that can never be quenched, no not to them that are caſt into it, the raiſed bodies of men being in that equal to the evil angels, they can never more ceaſe to be or be ever free from ſencible Suffering, nor will the Worm in their Spirits ever ceaſe tormenting; This is that lake of fire into which the firſt Death and Hell ſhall be caſt, when they have delivered up all the dead that was in them, and ſo ſhall be deſtroyed and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in this that ſhall remain and burn on all the ungodly for ever, ſee for this, and who they are, and when they ſhall be caſt into it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 11. 15. and 21. 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. 46 with <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 43 48. ſo that out of this, after men are in it, here is no deliverance in any ſence; but none are in this until they be brought forth of their graves, and delivered up by Death and Hell as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, except thoſe that at his appearing ſhall be taken and caſt alive into that lake of fire, without being detained any time in priſon as the reſt are, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 20. with chap. 20. 10.</p>
                  <p>Now had theſe men underſtood the Scripture, and ſo theſe things as there diſtinguiſhed and ſet forth, they would not have counted it at all abſurd, that ſouls in Hell (bodies in duſt, and ſpirits in priſon) ſhould come forth again to receive their final judgement, yea had they in the leaſt believed God to be true in his ſayings, they would not have dared ſo plainly to have contradicted and blaſphemed them, though they could not have underſtood them, ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh expreſly of the Final and Eternal Judgement, when all the dead that have died in their ſins from the beginning of the World to the latter end of it, ſhall at once be raiſed and brought forth to that judgement, and there and to that faith, Death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them.</p>

of Chriſt, and as Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Teachers of Chriſt, but in a directly oppoſite and contrary ſtrain (though ſubtilly and with hidden things of diſhoneſty, for ſuch are falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>They to prepare and make way for their falſe Apoſtolizing, in which they lift up ſomething elſe in the name and place of Chriſt, in reſpect of what he hath already done, and is become in himſelf for us and for their falſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, in which they magnifie ſomething elſe in the name and place of him, in reſpect of what he will do in his ſecond and glorious appearing, and for their falſe Teaching, in which they direct to another Light and Teacher, and teach otherwiſe, not conſenting to ſound words, even the Words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine according to goodlineſſe; to this purpoſe we ſay, they ſeek with deſign in the firſt place to caſt him down from his excellency in his perſon and works, and to render his Ordinances contemptible, and that they may effectually pull down the houſe with both their hands (as the fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) they purſue their wicked enterprize in this order, as may be ſeen in theſe Queries.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seeking to make void and of no effect the Perſonal Croſs of Chriſt in what he hath already done and compleated in himſelf thereby for men, and ſo privily to deny the Lord that bought them, and render the Preaching of his Croſs and faith in him of no effect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To overthrow the Hope of the Goſpel, even of the ſecond perſonal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt from Heaven, and the Salvation then to be revealed, and ſo to undermine the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thereby to render needleſs, uſeleſs and contemptible, thoſe his wayes and Ordinances, in which he hath appointed us to remember him in what he hath done, and thence to conſider him in what he is thereby become for us and to us, and to be exerciſed in our waiting for his ſecond coming, and the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then to be revealed, and ſurely where they can prevail in the two firſt, they may eaſily prevail in the latter, for to what end or purpoſe ſhould they obſerve any of thoſe his wayes and Ordinances that are appointed for remembering and ſhewing forth the Lords death, and the infinite and abiding virtue and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of that, and that in them we ſhould be exerciſed to an expectation and waiting for his ſecond coming, who believe neither, ſo as to have their faith in the firſt, and from thence their hope of the ſecond; for if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt riſen from the dead, and then neither can there be any expectation of his coming again in that body in which he ſuffered, or of any hope by him in or of another life after death, and then the Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is vain, and the Ordinances as delivered by them of no uſe or worth to be kept by us, baptizing in the Name of Chriſt as delivered by them, and ſo the Supper of the Lord empty and unprofitable things.</p>
                  <p>And doubleſſe if theſe men (as they ſeem to intimate) do grant any uſe of ſuch an Ordinance for ſhewing forth the Lords Death at any time, yet then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they mean it not otherwiſe, then as for commemorating and ſhewing forth a type or ſhadow, whoſe truth and body is to be ſought for in ſomething elſe, and not in the thing commemorated, or elſe by the Lord they mean not that
<pb facs="tcp:110170:81"/>
Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom God hath made Lord and Chriſt, and by that they call the Lords death, they mean not that death of his Croſſe, which he once ſuffered in that body of his fleſh for our ſins, and can ſuffer or die no more; And however that they have no Faith in him, or theſe things of him, is fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in their former queſtions, but ſeek to lift up ſomething elſe in the Name and place of him, and then what profit can there be to them in treating with them about his Ordinances, while they are ſo wholly void of judgement in the great things of his Law, as before is ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>But for the help of others, that are not yet wholly turned aſide after Satan, we anſwer to this Query,</p>
                  <p>That the taking, bleſſing, and breaking Bread, and the taking and bleſſing the cup, and ſo eating and drinking of them, as Chriſt hath appointed, to ſhew forth the Lords death, is an Ordinance to continue in the Church till the end of the World, or (which is all one) till his coming again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26 and 10. 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24 3. and 28. 20. And for further helpful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the underſtanding and uſe of it, we add</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The thing to be commemorated, and ſhewed forth in that Ordinance, is not our Mortifications, ſufferings, qualifications or works wrought in, or by us; but the Lords death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The death of him that was the Lord from Heaven before he died even in the beginning with God the proper Lord, and heir of all the Kingdom and glory of God; for the Father ſent forth his onely begotten Son, by his Grace to taſte death for us, which ſhews our ſinfulneſſe, miſerie and helpleſneſſe, and ſo the neceſſity of his death for us in reſpect of us, as alſo its Excellency for our help likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its the death of him that is the Lord, Gloriouſly made both Lord and Chriſt, in that body in which he died, and by means of his death for us, for he died once, and can die no more, but is now alive for evermore, and hath the keyes of Hell and Death, which ſhewes the preciouſneſſe of his death for us, ſeeing by means of it he ever liveth for us in the Power and Glory of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. This is to be remembered, and ſo commemorated, and ſhewed forth in that Ordinance as that which is alwayes and for ever to be remembred, and that imports,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the thing itſelf the Lords death, as to the actual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſuſtaining of it, is already paſt and over, being finiſhed in his own body; For remembrance is of things paſt (as is fore hinted.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that the precious virtue and efficacie of it abides for ever with the Father for us, in his appearing in his preſence in that body Glorified as Lord and Chriſt by means thereof, and ſo remaines in and through him (that is the Lord) in the Name of the Father to us. Likewiſe,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the vertue, efficacy and fruit of it is brought to us, in the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of his Croſſe, and through the witneſſes of it, and of the Grace in and through it, and to be met within the believing remembrance and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, for with the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſſion is made to Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That therefore he hath appointed together with the Preaching of the
<pb facs="tcp:110170:81"/>
Croſſe, this outward Ordinance for the remembering and ſhewing forth the Lords death till he come; Which implyes, that there is even in believers, in their ſeveral ages, till that his coming again, natural dulneſſe and proneneſſe to forget it, and with that alſo a natural aptneſſe to be either looking ſingly on their ſins, or enemies to their diſcouragement and fainting in the way, or elſe on their perſonal Mortifications, Sufferings, Victories or Works, to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and lifting up themſelves in ſomething that is not the Lord, and therefore need of ſuch mementoes.</p>
                  <p>And it ſhews the Gratious mind of God to us, that we ſhould have the Lords death alwayes in remembrance, and in our acknowledgement (which onely will keep us from fainting in the way, and inſtruct and ſtrengthen to relinquiſh all rejoycing in the fleſh, for the Excellency of the knowledge of him,) and therefore he hath appointed ſuch means to ſtir us up, by putting in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance often.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. This Ordinance is by the Lord appointed to the Church, and ſo to be uſed in it, and in the ſocieties of it, whereever two or three are gathered in his Name, in the beliefe of his ſayings, and of the Grace commended through his death drawn into him, and knit together in the Unity of the Spirit, who yet alſo in their Preaching the Goſpel to all as they have opportunity, are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and invite others that hear or liſten to their word, to come into his houſe and rejoyce with his People, even in obſervance of his Ordinances with them, and this for one, <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 20. Rom. 15. 9, 10, 11. Prov. 9. 1. 5. Mat.</hi> 22. 1. 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. That the way of this ſolemn publick and profeſſed remembrance and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Lords death, appointed to be uſed in his Church, or the thing to be done therein, is, that in their aſſemblies together, Believers do take the Bread, bleſſe it in his Name, break it, and with inſtruction about his ſufferings, all of them take and eat of it in Remembrance of him; and in like manner the Wine, ſo drinking in Remembrance of him, for as oft as they eat this Bread, and drink this cup they do ſo, and therein profeſſedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate, and ſhew forth the Lords death till he come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. 26. and 10. 6. For otherwiſe, he that knoweth and believingly mindeth the Lords Death, doth both and eating and drinking, and in all mercies and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, and in all his approaches to God, remember the Lords death, as that by which all good was procured for him, and all things are ſanctified to him, and therefore in all his demeanour is worthy to be acknowledged by him, though ſeducers would draw him from it, which with the former conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons renders Ordinances for ſtirring up by putting in remembrance the more needfull.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. That this remembrance, and ſhewing forth the Lords death is to be till he come, is expreſſe in the Scripture their Query ſeems to alude to, even till that his ſecond coming, of which we have ſpoken before, for his firſt appearing was actually paſt and finiſhed, for of that, and the infinite and abiding virtue and Grace of it, this was appointed to be a commemoration; And for his Spiritual comings, he had already ſent and powered forth the Holy Ghoſt, according to his promiſe after his aſcenſion, and theſe had received of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:82"/>
yea ſo as they were inriched in knowledge, utterance, Spiritual gifts, coming behind in none, even as the Teſtimony of Chriſt was confirmed in them, yet waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. 7. That coming here ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. which is ſtill to be waited for by all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, even all the time of this preſent World, and that in the uſe and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Ordinances each in their ſeveral times here, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. 13. And that that his ſecond coming, and the end of the World that now is, and ſo the beginning of the World to come (of which <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the faithful are Heires, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. &amp;c.) Shall be together at the ſame time, is evident, in <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19, 20, 21. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5, 8. with 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. to the end.</p>
                  <p>Yea further alſo, it is cleare and expreſſe in the promiſe annexed to the Commandment given by our Saviour (after his Reſurrection) to his Apoſtles, (and therein, in a ſecondary ſence to them that after believe through their word, <hi>John</hi> 17. 18. 20.) That believers in and with the Preaching of the Goſpel to the Nations, after baptiſing them in his name, are to teach them according to their capacity, to obſerve whatſoever Chriſt commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (to obſerve, and do after his Reſurrection, whereof this Ordinance is one) and this to the end of the World; ſo much we ſay is clear in the promiſe annexed to that Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. And ſo I am with you alway (that is, not onely to ſtrengthen them to keep this charge, but alſo to make them ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull and fruitful therein) in their Preaching this Goſpel, and keeping his Ordinances, and Teaching others to obſerve them with them, even unto the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>Yea and they alſo kept and obſerved this charge unto the end of the World, not onely in that they kept it in their perſonal exerciſe throughout their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to the finiſhing their courſe, even untill their diſeaſe and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of their mortal bodies, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 13. But alſo in this that they have made known and given for the Preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Revelation of the Miſtery, and have therein delivered the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or Ordinances, and things delivered over from the Lord to them, even as they received them of him, unto all Nations or Generations of men in this World, not onely then in being, but then to come, for the obedience of Faith, and that all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might hear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. and 16. 25, 26. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. 23. 27. and 14. 36, 37. And have alſo committed and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the charge of this Miniſtry unto faithfull men, with inſtruction and charge to them to deliver and commit the ſame to other faithful men, that ſo it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered &amp; kept after their deceaſe, even unto the end of the World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18. and 5. 21, 22. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 6. with Chap. 2. 2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. 15. with Chap. 2. 1. 2. and 3. 1. 3. And ſo <hi>Timothy</hi> is vehemently charged to keep this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment without ſpot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (which in his times he ſhall ſhew, as <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19, 20, 21.) 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6. 14, 15. Likewiſe alſo even ſuch as are called to the obtaining of the Glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming, are ſtill exhorted in their ſeveral ages even untill that his coming, when all his Saints ſhall be gathered together unto him, to hold faſt the Traditions which they have been taught by the Apoſtles Doctrine, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 14, 15. with ver. 1. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. 7. and 4. 11. 14. and 10. 19.

25. And ſo to do this in remembrance of him till he come, for till then they need ſuch helps, for now in this time of their imperfect ſtate, till they ſhall all come together to the full ſtature, here they ſee through a glaſſe, but when he comes they ſhall no more need ſuch helps, but ſee face to face even as now they are ſeen and know as they are known, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 12. 1 John</hi> 3. 2. Yea, until he come, thoſe of them that live on the Earth are mortal, as well as ſtill incumbred with a law of ſin in the members warring againſt the Law of the mind, and ſo the body dead becauſe of ſin, and the reſt of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the body is wholly dead, and turns to duſt (yet ſleeping in the Lord) and ſo our body, or Cougregation in ſome ſence vile, but at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our bodies ſhall be raiſed and made immortal, and every particular, and ſo our whole body or Congregation together made like his Glorious Body, (who is our head) and appearing with him in Glory, <hi>Col. 2. 3, 4. 1 John 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They alſo ſhew their Antichriſtian denial of Chriſts being already come in the fleſh, and having finiſhed the works given him to do on the Earth, in that his firſt appearing to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, that the Lords death cannot be ſhewed forth in that Ordinance of the Supper, appointed by him to that purpoſe, without an outward paſſeover; For in the Ordinance of the paſſeover which was outward, there was blood ſhed, and ſprinckled, and the Lamb roaſted and eaten, and ſo there was not onely a commemoration of that paſſing over them by the deſtroying Angel, and their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but alſo a Type of Chriſt the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſin of the World, who then was to come, and to be ſlain and ſacrificed for us; And ſo his blood, his virtuous ſufferings and death to be preſented to God, in his aſcending in that ſpotleſſe body, to appear in the preſence of God for us, that in his Name, it might be Spiritually ſprinkled on us, in the Preaching of the Croſſe, and ſo he fed upon by Faith as come in the fleſh; But this Grace was not yet ſo brought forth and manifeſted, the works of the firſt appearing of Chriſt not finiſhed, the offering of his body once for all not actually perfected, and while they were not ſo, the firſt Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Typical Ordinances of Divine ſervice had their ſtanding and uſefulneſs as Types and ſhadowes of good things to come, in which was not a lively Image of them; But now he who is the Body and Truth of all, even the fountaine of Grace and Truth, being come in the fleſh, and having been ſlain and offered up himſelf in Sacrifice for us, and by his blood even by means of his death, and with the virtue of it entered into Heaven it ſelf, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
<pb facs="tcp:110170:83"/>
in the preſence of God for us, from thence to quicken, cleanſe, and feed us with his own blood as aforeſaid; All ſuch like bloody and Typical Sacrifices and obſervances are taken away, that he may confirm the truth of all fulneſſe and compleatneſſe now found in him, and eſtabliſh his appointments, who (and not <hi>Moſes</hi>) is the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion, yea there being herein a change of the Prieſthood, there muſt alſo be of neceſſity a change of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and 9.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we are inſtructed to keep the feaſt, with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth, and to celebrate the memorial of the Lords death in ſuch manner, and in ſuch an Ordinance as aforeſaid, without any outward paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe Chriſt our paſſeover is not now ſlaying or ſacrificing, or to be ſlain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But is already ſacrificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. With the Scriptures fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, nor could any ſuch outward paſſeovers ſhew forth the Lords death, as paſt to be remembred; But the obſervance of it would be a denial of his death, as actually ſuſtained, paſt and finiſhed, and a ſignification of it as yet to come; therefore although it was very proper for our Saviour to obſerve and eat it with his Diſciples at that time before he ſuffered, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 15. Yet he left no ſuch commandment with them, that they ſhould any more obſerve it, ye he fully ſignifies to them, that they ſhould no more obſerve it, or have any occaſion for it, but that the very thing ſhadowed, and Typically held forth in it as to come, ſhould now be accompliſhed and fulfilled in his perſonal body through ſufferings, and ſhould be given them to remember and feed upon, as ſo compleated in him, whence after the eating of the paſſeover with them, he took Bread and bleſſed, and break, and gave to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe alſo, the cup after Supper, ſaying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And having ſo done and inſtructed them in the end and uſe of it; He then ſpeaking of that diſtinctly, and not of the paſſeover, appointed them to do this in remembrance of him, and ſo alſo the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand, that it was of that and not the former Ordinance, but of that obſerved and inſtituted after Supper, of which he ſaid do this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24. Yea his inſtituting that imediately after his eating the paſſeover with them, and then appointing them to do, that is as much as if he had ſaid, Chriſt your paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over is now preſently to be ſlain and ſacrificed for you, and therefore you ſhall have no more uſe or occaſion for this obſervance, the thing typified and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by it being come; But inſtead thereof do you this, and teach others, this obſervance in remembrance of what is done at this time for you, for now is Chriſt your Paſſeover ſacrificed, my body given and broken, my Blood<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed, my Life powered out for you; Do ye this (not that any more but this) in remembrance of me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But what means this expreſſion in their Query, doth it really figure forth? As not liking the expreſſions of the Holy Ghoſt, that tell us, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhew forth the Lords death, they call it a figuring forth his death. Now this we find in Scripture, that patterns, ſhaddows, and reſemblances of good things to come, were ſaid to be figures of the true and Heavenly things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, reſembled, typified, or ſhadowed by them; for the time preſent they were figures while ſtanding of ſuch uſe, which was until the firſt appearing of Chriſt to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf was finiſhed; So the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> was a figure of him to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14.

                  <p>Yea that ſuch are their corrupt immaginations appeares, in their former queſtions, in which they ſignifie, that that Blood, Sufferings, and Death of Chriſt that is over and paſt, as to the actual accompliſhment and ſuſtaining thereof, &amp; was ſo finiſhed in that body, is not the Bread of Life, or the Drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and the purger of the Conſcience; But ſomething elſe figured by that which is now in a preſent and ſenſible being nigh to men, and in them, yea all

                  <p>For why elſe do they not as well queſtion our grounds for the continuance of this Ordinance of Baptiſing with water in his Name, as they have done that of the Lords Supper; ſeeing it is notoriouſly known, they make no more account of the one, then of the other.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall therefore here ſay the leſſe to this Hypocritical queſtion. But if any deſire to underſtand the grounds of our practice in that, they may ſee them at large, ſhewed by the Scriptures in Treatiſes made publick, the one by <hi>Joh.

                  <p>We might anſwer this demand, as our Saviour anſwers a like Queſtion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23, 24, 25.

The Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> whence was it, from Heaven, or of men? So might we here ſay, when they tell us, whether baptiſing with water (either by ſprinkling, or dipping) in the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> be an Ordinance from Heaven, to be ſtill obſerved by believers, and by them to be adminiſtred on any, then we will likewiſe tell them the ground of our practice in this.</p>
                  <p>But the Reader may be ſatisfied, that they make void the commandments of Chriſt in this as well as in the former, by their traditions both by their principles and practice; For firſt, in their principles, they deny that Jeſus to be the very Chriſt, in whom the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwells bodily, and ſo in whom the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt is, and then why ſhould any be baptized into his Name.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, in their practice, they wholly lay aſide and reject that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance as well as the other, as unprofitable and vain.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we reject their queſtion; And yet for further help to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, add this word or two about Baptiſm, in which we hope few of our foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned diſſenting brethren will much differ from us, waving in this place thoſe things in which they differ, for ſuch reaſons as is fore expreſſed.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are three Queſtions in one, and of divers natures, which is a falacious way of querying; To the firſt we ſay, we own <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who received Tythes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bleſſed him that had the promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 2. 6. We own alſo the good Prieſts under the Law that were of the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and had a commandment to take Tythes of the People according to the Law (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 5.) ſuch of them whoſe lips preſerved knowledge; We like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe own ſuch Preachers now, as having the Doctrine of Chriſt with fitneſſe to Preach it, do hold faſt that faithfull word, and Preach not themſelves, but Jeſus (even that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> whom God hath raiſed from the dead) the Lord, and themſelves ſervants for Jeſus ſake; Such as Preach repentance and remiſſion of ſins in his Name, who is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World, the Fountain of Grace and Truth, that of his fulneſſe men might receive, and ſo do wait for, and in ſhewing thoſe things of him, that is the ground of it, inſtruct others to look for that bleſſed hope, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; And to flee from the wrath to come in the Reſurrection of the dead, and Eternal Judgement by that man by whom he hath ordained to judge the World in
<pb facs="tcp:110170:90"/>
Righteouſneſſe, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men in that he hath raiſed him from the dead; And ſo with that Doctrine of Chriſt, and in the Preaching of it do Adminiſter their inſtructions, and reproofs to ſuch as are Ignorant and out of the way, and for conviction of the gain-ſayers, and their exhortations to all, with conſolations, &amp; admonitions, to believers, to the edifying and teaching them, that denying ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, they ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such Preachers we own, whether they take Tythes or no. And further we ſay, <hi>the Labourer is worthy of his hire, Luke</hi> 10. 7. <hi>And thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9. &amp;c. They may, if they ſee it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, according to the inſtructions and liberty given them by him, take ſuch things as God by his providence orders to them, and ſets before them; Be it the Tenth, or what part it will that is appointed them by the Fathers of the Countrey, of that which is at their diſpoſe, or that is otherwiſe produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to them by the Goſpel; But all that take Tythes we own not, no more then we do all that refuſe them, we make not their taking or leaving them our rule for knowing or owning Preachers, but leave that groſs way of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch, as being Reprobate concerning the Faith, have no better rule to walk by.</p>
                  <p>To the other two parts of this Queſtion, we ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We diſtinguiſh between taking Hire, Gifts, or Rewards, and Preaching for them, and ſo being hirelings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as Preach for Hire, or for Gifts, and rewards, and ſo for filthy Lucre, in their ſo doing we own not, but are inſtructed to flee that vile luſt, and to warn others of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. Yet it is not our parts, to judge the hearts of men, yea though therebe ſome failings, (but rejoyce if Chriſt be Preached) and not to account any to be hirelings, until it appear by their fleeing when the Wolfe comes to devour the ſheep of their faith, and hope of the Goſpel, and ſo of their fallowſhip in the Word and Ordinances thereof; he that then neglecteth and fleeth from the ſheep as not caring for them, but leaving them to the Thief and Wolfe, he flyeth becauſe he is an hireling, and by his flight may be judged ſo to be, <hi>John</hi> 10. 10, 11, 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <head>24. Query. <hi>What is the Soul of man which the Word of God is to ſave, and what is the difference between the Soul and the Spirit, ſeeing the Word of God divides them aſunder?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This hath two Queſtions diſtinct, the firſt is what is the Soul of man which the Word of God is to ſave? To which we ſay,</p>
                  <p>Its the Soul of man that God hath made, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 16. And that by ſin was defiled, corrupted and loſt, for the Son of man came to ſave that which was loſt; But happily they think to intimate ſomething in this to ſtrengthen their denial of the Reſurrection and Redemption of the dead body, as to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that becauſe the Soul onely is mentioned as to be ſaved by the Word of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. and 5. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. Therefore the dead body is not to be ſaved, or Redeemed from death after the natural and bodily death.</p>
                  <p>We therefore further ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Soul of man is underſtood in Scripture in a twofold ſence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Sometimes for the Spirit, Soul, or inward man diſtinct from the body or outward man, which at death departs out of the body, and returns to God that gave it, to be appointed to its proper place, and ſtill retains a ſenſible being, either in priſon or at liberty, even till the Reſurrection of the body when they ſhall be for ever reunited, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 18. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7. 3. <hi>John</hi> 2. And this is that in which the ſaving work of Chriſt begins, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hath its efficacy now, while yet the body is mortal and decaying, though it alſo works in and through the mortal body, to the devoting it to Chriſt, and ſtrengthening it to ſervice, and ſuffering, and preſerving blameleſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Soul or Souls of men, is frequently meant the whole perſon, Soul, and body, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 5. and 14. 21. and 46. 18. 22. 26, 27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 14. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3 20. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 13. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. 13. And ſo in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man it is ſaid, the Lord God formed man of the duſt of the Earth, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of Life, and man became a living Soul; And theſe are the Souls, even the whole perſons of men, for every of whom Jeſus Chriſt by the Grace of God taſted death, and gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that through him they might be ſaved, yea when the Soul and Body are ſpoken of diſtinctly, they are both mentioned, as bought with one price, that God might be Glorified in both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. And ſo that both even the whole man might be Sanctified and preſerved in Chriſt, and ſo blamleſſe even to the coming of the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. And as in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive, and appear before the Judgement, ſeat of Chriſt, to receive
<pb facs="tcp:110170:91"/>
the things done in the body, as before is ſhewed at large.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Word (whoſe Name is alſo called the Word of God) is ſometimes meant, that Word that was in the beginning with God, which Word is God, one God with the Father, &amp; Eternal Spirit (though diſtinct in reſpect of manner of being in the Godhead) the ſame that in the fulneſſe of time was made fleſh, and in that body of his fleſh, is now raiſed from the dead, and Glorified with the Fathers own ſelf, and made both Lord and Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. 2. 14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. 2. and 5. 7. And ſometimes by the Word of God, which alſo was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Word of Chriſt, of the Kingdom of Grace, of Salvation, of Life, is meant that Declaration or Revelation of his Name and Grace in Chriſt, as witneſſed and ſpoken forth by the one mouth of his Holy Apoſtles and Prophets ſince the World began, who have ſpoken to us in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 7 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. and 10. 36. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>John</hi> 5. 24 38. and 8. 31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. And it is the Word in this ſence, the Goſpel of Chriſt or Preaching of his Croſſe that is the Arm or Power of God to ſave, even to open the eyes of the blind, and turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the Power of Satan to God, and to the further ſaving the believers here in this Life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17. This is made able through him that is declared in it, and Spiritually preſent with it, to ſave the Soul, to build up and give the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the firſt fruits of the Spirit, to the making the Spirit alive for the Righteouſneſſe ſake, while yet the body is dead becauſe of ſin, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the whole man blameleſſe to the coming of Chriſt; For this is that which he the Son of man ſowes in the heart, and ingrafts there for the ſaving the Soul, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 19. <hi>Acts.</hi> 20 32. And ſo his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (that have it in their hearts) Miniſtering in this Word, are ſaid inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally to convert and ſave the Soul, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. 11. and 4. 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3 And ſo our further anſwer is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſaving or Salvation of the Soul includes the Salvation of the whole man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 20. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 19, 20. and 34. 22. and 72. 13, 14. For that which is not received now in ſome firſt fruits of enjoyment, yet is aſſured in and with Chriſt, and received by Faith, and in the hope that is by him, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10, 11. 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 19, 20. Beſides ſome of the forementioned Scriptures ſpeak of the Redemption, and Salvation to be revealed in the laſt time, (in which the body ſhall by him be redeemed from death, and all deceit and violence, and their former ſufferings be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 18. 23.) And do evidently include that under the redeeming of their Soul, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though no Scripture ſaith, the Soul onely, as diſtinguiſhed from the body, is to be ſaved by Chriſt; But contrariwiſe, that through him both may be ſaved. Yet in this ſaving work effected by his word, or through the Preaching of his Croſſe, the Soul is onely mentioned in divers Scriptures, as the ſubject of it, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the Spirit or Soul diſtinct that is made alive, and ſo chiefly the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Saving, or Redeeming here effected in this day, while yet the body diſtinct (though devoted and yeilded up to his diſpoſe, and ſo in ſome

                  <p n="2">2. The ſaving which is now effected in them, is wrought mediately through that word Preached in and by outward means, wayes and inſtruments; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that compleat ſaving in which the dead body ſhall be raiſed, redeemed, and faſhioned in to the likeneſſe of his glorious body, though it ſhall be by Chriſt, and by his mighty Voice, which now breathes, and is put forth in and with the Goſpel, yet by an immediate and wonderful putting forth of it, without the uſe of outward means, and inſtruments, according to the working where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next part of their Query is, what is the difference between the Soul and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſeeing the Word of God divides them aſunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that we anſwer, 1. The text ſaith not that the Word of God makes a difference between, or devides them aſunder one from another; But that it pierceth, even to the dividing aſunder both Soul and Spirit, and ſo of the Joints and Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; That is, it pierceth through all, and ſo as much through Spirit as Soul, to a diſcerning (and manifeſting too at his pleaſure) the counſels of the heart, even after the ſimilitude of a Sword that pierceth through a man, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides not one part from another, but makes way for it ſelf. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is diſtinction between Soul and Spirit in the Scriptures (though ſometimes both are comprehended under either of the termes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, the Spirit of a man (his mind or underſtanding, with the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or bent of his Soul) is the Candle of the Lord, which when lighted by him (by his inſpiration, giving underſtanding and fixing it) ſearcheth (or the Lord by it ſearcheth) all the inward parts of the belly.</p>
                  <p>And the Soul is that belly, or inward parts (in <hi>Solomons</hi> ſence) ſearched by it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. Even all the faculties of the Soul and its exerciſes, with the thoughts and intents of the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12, 13. Anſwerable to which diſtinct ſence of Soul and Spirit is that profeſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 46, 47. and calling upon both, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1.

But the light in theſe men is darkneſſe, and hath robbed them of all right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Chriſt who is the Wiſdom of God. And the fool ſaith in his heart, there is no God; Yea, Father, even thoſe Natural ſtreams of Light, are alſo to men in due time Spiritual in their end and effecacy, for they all come to lead to him, and ſo to the enjoyment of that Eternal life in him, and to that purpoſe have the preſence and concurance of the ſupernatural Light and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Spirit in and with them unto men, witneſſing his goodneſſe lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Repentance, <hi>Rom</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. &amp;c. But our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer forementioned, as we ſaid before, gives no ground at all for any ſuch infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that any one ſtream of Light that every one is lighted with is both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Spiritual, nor did we at all confute ourſelves in what <hi>T.

And while we ſo aſert, we likewiſe aſſert withal, as plainly ſhewed in the ſame Scriptures of Truth, That when he doth thus witneſſe or manifeſt the knowledge of his Goodneſſe and Truth unto the minds or ſpirits of men, then alwayes he requires ſomething of them according to what he gives, namely, that they ſhould know him, receive his ſayings, or witneſſes of his goodneſſe, and thence love him, and ſo glorifie him in the day of their viſitation, according to the means uſed and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his goodneſſe therein vouchſafed, that henceforth they ſhould live to him that died for them, and roſe again; See the forecited Scriptures, with <hi>Eccle.</hi> 9. 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 5.</p>
                  <p>But of Children in their infancy no ſuch thing is required expreſly, becauſe they have not known, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:110170:94"/>
they know not to chuſe the good and refuſe the evil, and no ſuch knowledge being given them, nothing of that nature is required of them, though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of Gods Grace in Chriſt are affirmed true concerning them, and his free promiſes in Chriſt to them, and ſo to be witneſſed by his ſervants</p>
                  <p>But ſo ſoon as God requires any hearing, knowing, or acknowledgement of his Grace of any, he prevents them with his Grace, bringing Salvation to them, even by his Spirit to their ſpirits as before, ſowing his Words in their hearts, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19.</p>
                  <p>And further we ſay, that when the light of the knowledge of God comes to them it ſhines in darkneſſe, it finds them in darkneſſe, yea dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. and 5. 25. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. 4. Elſe no need of ſhining light into them from without them at leaſt, not of ſuch light as in which is both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the objects, or things to be known, as alſo giving of underſtanding, or opening the eyes of the minde to perceive what is diſcovered, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 130. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                  <p>Again we ſay, that if when light comes, men love darkneſſe, and like not to retain God in their knowledge, they are ſtill darkneſſe, and have not the knowledge of God; So the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were ſometimes darkneſſe, but now ſaith the Apoſtle ye are light, (yet he ſaith not in themſelves, but) in the Lord, who is the Fountain and Original of their light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 34.</p>
                  <p>But if any perſiſt in their chuſing darkneſſe when light comes, or on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reject, or after receiving the knowledge of the Truth, put it away from them, till his holy Spirit have done ſhining with them, and he take it away from them; Then they are left to hardneſſe and blindneſſe, and have no true or morning light in them, but a mind void of Judgement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>Jude.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we read of many that under one or other of theſe conſiderations, that is either not having heartily received, or not retaining, or having reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the utmoſt, are truly ſaid to have no morning light or knowledge of Chriſt the morning Star in them, (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20.) no truth in them; Yea, that is expreſly affirmed of ſuch as ſay they have no ſin, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. 10.</p>

His preſerving man, and other Creatures for his uſe, and ſo his giving Rain from Heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, <hi>&amp;c</hi> His patience and bounty to ſinners, yea his forbearance, and long ſuffering to rebellious ſinners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 5, 6. and 68. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 16, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. with <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. 15. Though of men, his Saints do onely truly bleſſe him with the Mouth or Tongue, and from the Heart, where the underſtanding and knowledge of his Goodneſſe is received and precious; Yet alſo all his works do, and more Gloriouſly ſhall praiſe him, he never left himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, to make known to the Sons of men his mighty Acts, and the Glorious Majeſty of his Kingdom; Yea ſo wonderful is he in working, he knows how to make the wrath of man, which of it ſelf works not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, yet turn to his Praiſe; But what is this to their purpoſe? What makes this for proving ſuch Spiritual Light (as aforeſaid) in every man more then in every beaſt, or plant? Do theſe men ſuppoſe that every thing that may be a witneſſe for God unto men, hath the underſtanding of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they bear, or of the thing witneſſed, or Light and capacity to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in them? Surely when God opened the mouth of an Aſſe, ſhe ſpake more truly and to purpoſe then theſe men; Yet who will ſay, ſhe had in her the underſtanding of the warning and reproof God gave to <hi>Balaam</hi> therein, or light and capacity thereto, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 28. 30. Or that the Pillar of the Stones, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 45. 48. 52. had in them the underſtanding or light of the Covenant of which they were a witneſſe, or that all the things that are made, as the Sun ſhinning, the Rain falling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have the light or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in them, of the things witneſſed in them to man-ward, and that may be clearly ſeen and underſtood by them; Doubtleſſe they are brutiſh that would ſo infer.</p>
                  <p>But it is no ſtrange thing for men that have no Faith in Chriſt, but are void of Judgement concerning that, to be alſo unreaſonable, or abſurd, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. Nor for ſuch as are ſeeking after, and profeſſing to be wiſe in themſelves, to become moſt fooliſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22, 23.</p>

things of diſhoneſty, but by a plain manifeſtation of the Truth in the words of Truth, have declared our mind and meaning in our words, That others when they read may underſtand our knowledge in the myſteries of Chriſt, Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our meaſure, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2, 13. &amp; 2. 17. &amp; 4. 1, 2. <hi>Ephſ.</hi> 3. 4. And have been the larger for the helpfulneſſe of ſuch as will read and conſider our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, Deſiring them to ſearch the Scriptures whether theſe things be ſo; And ſo far as any in reading, and by ſearching and comparing the Scriptures, may be helped to underſtand the things that we have written to be contained in, and confirmed by the words of Truth, let them ſo receive them as the Word of God and not of man. And if in any thing they find we ſpeak not according to that word, let them refuſe it, and ſhew us in love by evidence of Scripture, our miſtake, and we ſhall thankfully accept it, (for we dare not make our ſelves of the number, or compare our ſelves with ſome that commend themſelves, &amp;c. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12, 13. for not he that commendeth himſelf, but whom the Lord commendeth is approved, verſe 18.) But let none be either over-haſty to believe every word before he find it contained and confirmed in the words of our Lord Jeſus, and in the Doctrine which is according to godlineſſe, nor yet to ſpeak evil of the things he knows not, That is, if he cannot yet ſee it to be according to that word already delivered in the Law and Teſtimony, and yet neither can be thereby ſatisfied, that it is not according to it, or that the lip of knowledge is not in it, let him ſuſpend his judgement, and ſtill wait in the believing mindfulneſſe of the great things in the Doctrine of Chriſt for further under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for ſo its meet to be ſaid unto God, what I ſee not teach thou me. Nor have we in our anſwers to theſe queries, or in any of our dealings with theſe men, walked according to any other Rule, or done by them otherwiſe then we would that men ſhould do by us; That is, we have not declared and proteſted againſt any of their corrupt principles as evil and Antichriſtian, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we have been fully aſſured by the word of God, that they are ſuch as may be ſeen by our ſhewing them thereby to be ſuch; for ſo ſuch inſtructions as have not the lip of knowledge in them, but do cauſe to erre from the words of knowledge, they may be by the light of the Lord known and diſcerned to be ſuch, and as ſuch to be avoyded; though the depths of Satan in them; what their lip is, and whitherto it tends, their wayes being moveable, and their Depths in the bottomleſſe pit, we cannot know them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5. 6. And therefore it is not our work to ſearch or enquire into them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 24. 25. But in the holding faſt that which we have heard from the beginning of the word of the beginning of Chriſt, So ſoon as ever we perceive and know by the light thereof, that the lip of knowledge is not in any Doctrine or ſpirit that comes to us, That it lifts not up the Son of man, by taking of his things, and ſhewing them; but tends to render him undeſirable in what he hath done, is doing and will do, and to withdraw from the words of knowledge, we are then preſently to depart from ſuch, to ceaſe to hear them, and let them be to us as an accurſed thing, not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be conſidered, or pondered by us, and ſo to warn others of them, for with good words and fair ſpeeches, even ſuch may eaſily deceive the hearts of the ſimple; that in confidence of their own ſtrength, and out of an unſtable mind and itching ear will be often tempting God, and trying and pondering
<pb facs="tcp:110170:96"/>
their moveable paths, after they have perceived that the lip of knowledge is not in them, but the Preaching of the perſonal ſufferings of Chriſt, fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them; We have therefore left this for an inſtruction and warning to others, that the Truth of the Goſpel may remain with believers, and that ſuch as are Ignorant and out of the way may be recovered.</p>
                  <p>And further we deſire of the Reader, if ever he ſee any reply to this of ours, he would diſtinctly obſerve, if they pervert not, or alter our ſayings, by taking them in pieces, and changing expreſſions to marr the ſence, if alſo they give not a go-by to the matters of the greateſt weight and importance, and onely lie at the catch to get ſome by-matters or words to ſtrive &amp; ſnarle about, which can tend to no profit, but to the ſubverting the Reader from the things chiefly to be minded; And in obſervance of this caution, we doubt not but the Reader will be ſatisfied even from themſelves, concerning their Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſpirit, without our adding any more by way of return to theirs; Which though we will not bind our ſelves from, yet we do not reſolve to do, though they ſhould give us occaſion by ſuch ſorry ſhifts and pretended anſwers as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they have returned.</p>
                  <p>As for their ſlanders and revilings that follow, we weigh them not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to him that judgeth Righteouſly, who will at that his ſecond coming (which they ſcoff at) when He the Son of man ſhall appear in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, make their folly manifeſt to all men, and bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe; Then it ſhall fully appear who have walked in craftineſſe, Pride, Hypocriſie, and hidden things of diſhoneſty, in the mean time we are during his good pleaſure, in his Name and ſtrength, his witneſſes againſt it all.</p>
